  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Atlanta (A): 45,000 cases on hand / 60,000 capacity (75% util.).  \n- Miami (B): 8,000 cases on hand / 50,000 capacity (16% util.).  \n- Product: VoltRush Tropical, unit cost $9.80/case, shelf life 270 days.  \n- Demand (Miami region): forecast 25,000 units/week, trending +10% and seasonality 1.4 \u2192 adjusted demand = 25,000 * 1.1 * 1.4 = 38,500 units/week \u2248 5,500 units/day.  \n- Promotion: \u201cSummer Kickoff\u201d begins in 4 days. Supplier production of 15,000 cases for Miami is scheduled ready in 3 days but the plant has been missing schedule 1\u20132 days; supplier reliability score = 0.82.  \n- Transport options: temp-controlled FTL quote = $3,000/load (2,000 cases/load) \u2192 5 loads needed for 10,000 cases \u2192 $15,000. Last month base was $2,500/load; $3,000 is +20% premium. Dry vans $2,200/load (quality risk). Transit 1\u20132 days.  \n- Costs: carrying cost = $0.02/unit/day; stockout penalty = $5.50/unit.\n\nKey Factors\n- Promotion timing: 4 days until start \u2192 cumulative demand before promotion \u2248 4 days * 5,500/day = 22,000 cases.\n- Current on-hand in Miami (8,000) is well below 22,000 \u2014 gap must be covered by transfer + supplier delivery to avoid stockout.\n- Supplier uncertainty: reliability 0.82 implies non-trivial chance of late production; recent misses (1\u20132 days) increase risk.\n- Freight premium buys temp-controlled integrity and guaranteed timing (arrives within 1\u20132 days).\n- Operational constraint: minimum shipping increment is 2,000 cases/load; you can only ship multiples of 2k.\n\nCost Analysis (numbers)\n1) Freight cost to move 10,000 cases by temp-controlled FTLs:\n   - 5 loads * $3,000 = $15,000.\n\n2) Carrying cost impact (daily):\n   - Moving 10,000 cases shifts carrying cost from Atlanta to Miami: net daily carrying change \u2248 zero (10,000 * $0.02 saved in ATL vs 10,000 * $0.02 added in MIA).\n   - Over short promotion window (\u22647 days) carrying costs are small: 10,000 * $0.02 * 7 = $1,400.\n\n3) Stockout exposure (quantified expectation)\n   - Demand before promotion = 22,000 units.\n   - If no transfer: shortfall if supplier misses schedule (assume delay leads to supplier not arriving before day 4) = 22,000 - 8,000 = 14,000 units.\n     - Expected stockout cost = Prob(delay) * shortfall * $5.5.\n     - Using supplier reliability 0.82 \u2192 Prob(delay \u2248 0.18). So expected stockout cost (no transfer) = 0.18 * 14,000 * $5.5 = $13,860.\n   - If transfer 10,000 cases:\n     - On-hand before promotion (if supplier delayed) = 8,000 + 10,000 = 18,000 \u2192 shortfall = 22,000 - 18,000 = 4,000 units.\n     - Expected stockout cost = 0.18 * 4,000 * $5.5 = $3,960.\n   - Reduction in expected stockout cost by transferring 10k = $13,860 - $3,960 = $9,900.\n\n4) Combined expected cost (freight + expected stockout)\n   - No transfer: $0 freight + $13,860 expected stockout = $13,860.\n   - Transfer 10k (premiums): $15,000 freight + $3,960 expected stockout = $18,960.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Paying $15k freight reduces expected stockout exposure by $9,900 but still leaves total expected cost higher by ~$5,100 vs doing nothing (under base reliability assumption). In EV terms, paying the premium is not justified if the supplier delay probability is ~18% and stockout penalty is $5.50/unit.\n- To guarantee no stockout in the worst-case (supplier misses by 2 days), you would need to transfer >=14,000 cases (because 8,000 + transfer \u2265 22,000). That requires 7 FTLs \u2192 14,000 cases \u2192 freight = 7 * $3,000 = $21,000.\n- Dry vans are materially cheaper (5 * $2,200 = $11,000) but carry product-quality risk under Florida heat \u2014 potential spoilage/loss not quantified (could exceed any freight savings).\n\nBreak-even sensitivity\n- The premium (freight $15k) is justified only if the probability of supplier missing schedule enough to create the 14k shortfall is \u2265 p*, where:\n   saved expected stockout = p * 10,000 * $5.5 = p * $55,000.\n   break-even requires p * $55,000 \u2265 $15,000 \u2192 p \u2265 27.3%.\n- So if your realistic probability of the supplier missing schedule by 2+ days is >27%, paying the premium becomes EV-positive.\n\nRecommendation (actionable)\n1) Do NOT pay the full 20% premium to move 10,000 cases right now as a blanket decision given the base inputs (supplier reliability 0.82 \u2192 estimated delay prob ~18%). Expected total cost is lower if you wait (no transfer expected cost ~$13,860 vs $18,960 with premium).\n2) Implement a staged contingency/hedge:\n   - Immediately pre-book 2 temp-controlled FTLs (4,000 cases) to buy time and signal commitment to the promotion: cost = 2 * $3,000 = $6,000. This reduces worst-case shortfall if supplier slips by 2 days from 14k \u2192 10k.\n   - Simultaneously monitor supplier production status closely (daily) and set an automated trigger: if supplier confirms a delay beyond day 3 (or reliability signal drops), release funds to add 3 additional temp FTLs (3 * $3,000 = $9,000) to reach the full 10,000, or to 7 loads (14k) if you decide to fully hedge.\n   - Negotiate with Miami customers (major grocery chain) proactively\u2014ask for staged delivery timing or confirm that product arriving day 4 still secures endcap. This reduces the binary risk of losing the endcap.\n   - Avoid dry vans for promotional stock unless you can guarantee trailer temperature controls or very fast transit/handling; the reputational/quality risk is high.\n\nQuantified outcome of recommended staged plan (example)\n- Book 2 FTLs now ($6,000). If supplier is on-time, you avoid further freight spend and supplier delivery covers remaining demand. If supplier delays, you can add 3 more FTLs ($9,000) to reach 10k total freight $15,000 \u2014 but you only pay that extra when necessary. This reduces expected unnecessary spend while limiting upside stockout exposure.\n\nRisks / Uncertainties\n- Supplier delay probability: 0.82 reliability is an aggregate metric; recent misses suggest the actual risk of a 2-day miss could be higher. If true delay prob >27%, full premium is EV-justified.\n- Stockout penalty ($5.50/unit) may understate actual commercial consequences (losing endcap to competitor could cause larger lost incremental sales/reputational damage not captured by per-unit penalty).\n- Dry van quality risk and resulting spoilage/loss is not quantified \u2014 could be catastrophic.\n- Transit variability: quoted transit 1\u20132 days; if transit takes 2 days arrival could still be tight.\n- Inventory accuracy / safety stock at store level not provided \u2014 real local safety could be different.\n\nBottom line\n- Based on the numbers provided and using supplier reliability = 0.82 (delay prob \u2248 18%), paying the 20% premium to move 10,000 cases now is not justified in expected-cost terms (it increases expected total cost by \u2248 $5,100).  \n- Recommended tactical approach: pre-book a small hedge (2 FTLs = 4k cases for $6,000), monitor supplier closely, and top up to additional temp-controlled loads only if the supplier confirms a delay. If you judge (or have intelligence indicating) the supplier\u2019s delay probability is materially higher than 27% or if losing the retailer endcap would impose losses >$15k, then authorize the full temp-controlled move immediately.",
