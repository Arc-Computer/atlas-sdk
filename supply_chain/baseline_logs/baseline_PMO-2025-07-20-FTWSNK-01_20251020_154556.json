  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Warehouse A (Savannah): cap 250,000 units; on-hand 220,000 (88% util); available pallet positions \u2248 850 today. On-hand FTW-KID-SNK-04 = 45,000 units.\n- Warehouse B (Columbus): cap 200,000; on-hand 164,000 (82% util). On-hand FTW-KID-SNK-04 = 28,000 units.\n- Inbound PO GG-9102: 25,000 FTW-KID-SNK-04 units due at A in 3 days (requires \u2248250 pallet positions). Diverting to B adds +3 days transit and a 14.3% transport premium.\n- Demand environment (Q3 back-to-school peak): weekly forecast 8,500 units; actual trend +12% and seasonality 1.75 -> effective demand this week \u2248 8,500 * 1.12 * 1.75 = 16,660 units/week (\u22482,380 units/day). Regional split SE 60% (\u22489,996/week, \u22481,428/day), MW 40% (\u22486,664/week, \u2248952/day).\n- Uniform shipment AP-UNIFORM-PL (80,000 units) arrives at A in 4 days and requires 1,000 pallet positions for rapid cross-dock. Current available pallets (850) \u2192 baseline shortfall of 150 pallets even if sneakers are diverted; if sneakers are received at A, shortfall grows to ~400 pallets.\n- 3PL overflow costs: $25/pallet in/out (we interpret as $25 per pallet per movement \u2192 inbound + outbound = $50/pallet). 3PL error rate 2% (mis-picks). Retail partner penalty for uniform delay: $50,000 per day.\n- Costs: base inter-DC transport = $0.95/unit; transport premium = 14.3% (we treat as 14.3% surcharge on base transport); carrying cost $0.12/unit/day; stockout penalty $21.60/unit.\n\nKey Factors driving the decision\n- Space/time-critical uniform arrival at A with large retail penalty ($50k/day). Preventing disruption to that flow is highest priority.\n- Cost tradeoff between paying premium to divert sneakers vs. 3PL handling + mis-picks + retail penalties if sneakers consume A capacity.\n- B has labor shortage and will experience 24\u201348 hour putaway delays and dock congestion if it receives the full 25k; risk of short, localized fulfillment delays from B.\n- SKU demand is very high this season \u2014 both DCs need adequate inventory to avoid lost sales.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified)\n\nAssumptions and units-per-pallet:\n- Sneakers: 25,000 units \u2192 ~250 pallets \u21d2 100 units/pallet.\n- Uniforms: 80,000 units \u2192 1,000 pallets \u21d2 80 units/pallet.\n- 3PL fee interpreted as $25 per pallet per movement \u2192 $50 per pallet total (in + out).\n\nA) If inbound is received at A (do not divert)\n- A shortfall after receiving sneakers = ~400 pallets \u2192 3PL required pallets = 400.\n- 3PL handling cost = 400 pallets * $50/pallet = $20,000.\n- Units handled by 3PL (uniforms on those pallets) = 400 pallets * 80 units/pallet = 32,000 units.\n- Expected mis-picks = 2% * 32,000 = 640 units \u2192 estimated mis-pick cost (use stockout penalty proxy $21.6/unit) = 640 * $21.6 = $13,824.\n- Retail penalty risk: using 3PL and increased handling complexity raises risk of a 1+ day delay on the uniform cross-dock. Conservatively assign a 20% chance of a 1-day delay \u2192 expected penalty = 0.20 * $50,000 = $10,000 (this is expected value; worst-case single-day penalty is $50k).\n- Total expected incremental cost (no-divert) = 3PL $20,000 + mis-picks $13,824 + expected penalty $10,000 = $43,824.\n\nB) If inbound is diverted to B (use premium transport)\n- Transport cost (inter-DC base $0.95/unit plus 14.3% premium): surcharge = 0.95 * 0.143 = $0.136/unit. Total per-unit transport \u2248 $1.086.\n- Total transport cost for 25,000 units = 25,000 * $1.086 = $27,150. Incremental premium vs base = 25,000 * $0.136 = $3,400 (the marginal extra cost of diverting).\n- A shortfall (since sneakers not received) = 150 pallets \u2192 3PL pallets = 150.\n- 3PL handling cost = 150 * $50 = $7,500.\n- Units handled by 3PL = 150 * 80 = 12,000 units. Mis-picks = 2% * 12,000 = 240 units \u2192 mis-pick cost = 240 * $21.6 = $5,184.\n- B operational disruption: divert pushes B utilization to ~95% and creates 24\u201348h putaway delay. Potential downstream shipping impact: if 1 day of MW demand (\u2248952 units) is not fulfilled from B due to congestion, stockout penalty = 952 * $21.6 = $20,563. Assign a conservative 40% chance of a 1-day disruption given 75% headcount \u2192 expected disruption cost = 0.40 * 20,563 = $8,225.\n- Total expected incremental cost (divert) = incremental transport premium $3,400 + 3PL $7,500 + mis-picks $5,184 + expected B disruption $8,225 = $24,309.\n  - Note: if you count full transport (not only incremental), full transport = $27,150; my comparison below uses incremental premium since the decision is whether to redirect vs. original plan (original inbound to A likely has no inter-DC cost).\n\nTrade-offs and comparison\n- Expected cost (no-divert) \u2248 $43,824.\n- Expected cost (divert) \u2248 $24,309.\n- Net expected savings by diverting \u2248 $19,515 (using the assumptions above).\n- Much of the avoided cost is: lower 3PL usage (400 \u2192 150 pallets), lower mis-picks, and lower expected risk of the $50k/day uniform penalty.\n- Certainty-level: even ignoring the $10k expected penalty component, the certain parts alone (3PL + mis-picks) are:\n  - No-divert: $33,824 (3PL $20k + mis-picks $13,824)\n  - Divert: $16,084 (3PL $7.5k + mis-picks $5,184 + incremental transport $3,400)\n  => immediate guaranteed savings \u2248 $17,740 by diverting.\n- Risks from diversion: B\u2019s labor shortfall could create 24\u201348h putaway and possible short-term shipping disruptions in the Midwest, captured above as expected $8.2k. The diverted inventory will also be out of Southeast for an extra ~3 days of transit (arrives at B in ~6 days vs originally at A in 3 days) \u2014 but A still has 45k on-hand (\u224831.5 days of SE coverage at current demand), so immediate SE stockout risk is low.\n\nRecommendation (actionable)\n1. Divert the full 25,000-unit inbound PO GG-9102 to Warehouse B using premium transport this week.\n   - Rationale: Expected net savings \u2248 $19.5k under conservative assumptions, driven by avoided 3PL handling ($12,500 saved vs. full-receipt case) and reduced mis-pick risk, plus materially lower chance of triggering the $50k/day uniform penalty. Full diversion reduces A\u2019s 3PL requirement from 400 pallets \u2192 150 pallets.\n2. Immediate operational mitigations to minimize B disruption and realize the savings:\n   - Pre-authorize and fund 8\u201312 hours of overtime / temp hires at B on the expected putaway days to reduce 24\u201348h putaway to 0\u201324h. Estimated incremental labor cost (typical OT) will be small vs. the savings (get quotes from B ops; even $5\u201310k is acceptable).\n   - Prioritize the sneaker putaway as lower-touch bulk pallet putaway to speed flow; plan to stage some inbound for direct-to-pick if possible to avoid long putaway.\n   - Confirm carrier routing now to lock in premium and minimize further delays; attempt to negotiate or use existing lanes to keep the actual surcharge near the modeled 14.3% (monitor final invoice).\n   - Pre-notify outbound picking teams at B to sequence any at-risk orders and confirm available pick locations to reduce dock congestion.\n3. Contingency at A:\n   - Reserve the 150 3PL pallet slots (contractually) for the remaining overflow; lock service level agreement terms and quality checks to limit mis-picks.\n   - If possible, re-sequence uniform cross-dock and expedite critical retail lanes first; assign A a \u201cretail-critical\u201d staging area and supervisor to manage the uniform flow.\n4. Communicate to the retail partner (if required) that A will not receive the sneakers and that uniform delivery remains prioritized \u2014 reduce chance of penalty triggers.\n\nQuantified summary (rounded)\n- Incremental transport premium to divert: ~$3,400.\n- 3PL handling cost if not diverted: $20,000 vs if diverted: $7,500 \u2192 immediate savings $12,500.\n- Expected mis-pick cost avoided: ~$8,640 (13,824 \u2192 5,184).\n- Expected uniform penalty exposure materially reduced (expected $10,000 avoided under conservative 20% delay probability); worst-case avoided penalty is $50,000/day.\n- Net expected savings (conservative) \u2248 $19.5k. Upside is larger if the retail penalty materializes or if 3PL mis-pick impacts are costlier than modeled.\n\nRisks and key uncertainties\n- Interpretation of transport premium: I treated 14.3% as surcharge on base inter-DC transport ($0.95). If instead premium is 14.3% of unit value ($22.50) the cost rises substantially (~$3.22/unit * 25k \u2248 $80.5k) and the arithmetic would change \u2014 confirm invoice basis with freight procurement before executing.\n- Probability and magnitude of uniform-delay penalty are uncertain. If the 3PL route did not increase delay risk, the expected penalty avoided would be lower; however even excluding the penalty, diverting still shows ~ $17.7k certain savings (3PL + mis-pick reduction vs. premium).\n- B-side labor and putaway risk: if congestion at B causes a multi-day disruption and higher-than-expected stockouts, costs could rise; mitigation (OT/temp labor, prioritization) should be implemented at time of diversion.\n- Mis-pick cost per unit proxy used stockout penalty ($21.6); actual remediation cost may differ.\n\nBottom line\nDivert the 25,000-unit sneaker PO to Warehouse B using premium transport, and immediately execute mitigations at B (OT/temp labor, staging priority) and contingency at A (reserve 150 3PL pallets, QA controls). This action is expected to reduce total expected incremental cost by ~ $19.5k under conservative assumptions and materially lowers the probability of triggering the retail partner\u2019s costly uniform-delay penalty.",
