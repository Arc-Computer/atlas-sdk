  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Date/time: 2025-10-15. On-hand stock for SKU CE-GAN-65W-USB-C-CHGR = 2,800 units (Warehouse A = 1,680; Warehouse B = 1,120). Existing backorders = 240 units (west-heavy).\n- Inbound: 2,400 units currently in-transit (ETA revised to 2025-10-22). Open PO#78432 = 6,000 units from primary supplier projected to arrive under current conditions 2025-11-07 (can be expedited to 2025-10-27 for up to 3,000 units at an 18.7% line-haul premium).\n- Demand: baseline weekly forecast = 4,800 units. Adjusting for the +22% recent trend and seasonality 1.15 \u2192 adjusted weekly demand = 4,800 \u00d7 1.22 \u00d7 1.15 \u2248 6,734 units/week \u2192 \u2248962 units/day (non-promo). Promotion 2025-10-20 \u2192 2025-10-25 expected uplift ~+10\u201320% (use midpoint +15% \u2192 promo daily \u2248 1,106 units/day).\n- Alternate domestic supplier (Midwest GaN): confirmed availability up to 3,500 units, unit cost $15.01 (\u2248 +12%), can be ship-ready within 72 hours; freight $0.24/unit.\n- Costs: base inbound freight $0.36/unit; expedite premium = +18.7% of line-haul (additional \u2248 $0.0673/unit); carrying cost $0.008/unit/day; stockout penalty $6.50/unit.\n- Constraints: inter-warehouse transfer cost $0.35/unit, 3-day transit, capacity 1,200 units/day; expedite budget remaining $28,000.\n\nKey Factors (drivers of the decision)\n1. Timing mismatch: the promotion (10/20\u201310/25) starts before the earliest expedited primary PO arrival (10/27). The promotion window is the immediate risk period.\n2. High near-term demand: adjusted daily demand \u2248 962 units/day, promo days \u2248 1,106 units/day \u2014 burn rate will exhaust current on-hand quickly.\n3. In-transit 2,400 units arrive 10/22 (helps after the start of the promotion but doesn\u2019t prevent shortages on 10/20\u201310/21 unless other actions are taken).\n4. Alternate domestic supply can arrive in ~72 hours and can therefore cover the promotion; primary PO expedite to 10/27 cannot get stock to market in time for much of the promotion.\n5. Financials: stockout penalty ($6.50/unit) is large relative to incremental freight/price increases, so avoiding stockouts is high value.\n\nCost Analysis \u2014 baseline shortfall if no action\n- Demand 10/15\u201310/26 (12 days covering the promotion window and the days before in-transit arrival): \n  - 10/15\u201310/19 (5 days normal) = 5 \u00d7 962 = 4,810 units\n  - 10/20\u201310/25 (6 promo days) = 6 \u00d7 1,106 = 6,636 units\n  - 10/26 (1 normal) = 962 units\n  - Total demand 10/15\u201310/26 \u2248 12,408 units\n- Available before 10/26 if we take no new purchases and do not expedite: starting on-hand 2,800 + in-transit 2,400 (arriving 10/22) = 5,200 units \u2192 shortfall \u2248 12,408 \u2212 5,200 = 7,208 units\n- Potential stockout penalty (if unmet demand = full shortfall): 7,208 \u00d7 $6.50 \u2248 $46,852\n\nOption costs (incremental) and effects\n1) Expedite primary PO for up to 3,000 units (arrival 2025-10-27)\n   - Extra freight per unit = 0.36 \u00d7 0.187 \u2248 $0.0673 \u2192 additional cost for 3,000 units \u2248 $202\n   - Total freight per expedited unit \u2248 $0.427\n   - Effect: arrival 10/27 \u2014 helps reduce stockouts after 10/27 but does NOT materially cover the promotion 10/20\u201310/25 (arrives too late for promo). Good for reducing late-October shortfall and lowers risk versus supplier delays.\n   - Carrying impact: arriving earlier than 11/07 by 11 days reduces the backlog earlier; carrying cost change is minimal relative to penalty avoided (carry cost \u2248 3,000 \u00d7 $0.008 \u00d7 ~10 days \u2248 $240).\n\n2) Buy from Midwest GaN Solutions (domestic) \u2014 immediate order\n   - Unit cost vs primary: $15.01 \u2212 $13.40 = $1.61 extra per unit\n   - Freight $0.24/unit (cheaper than primary freight $0.36)\n   - Example purchase = 3,500 units (max availability confirmed)\n     - Extra product cost = 3,500 \u00d7 $1.61 = $5,635\n     - Freight = 3,500 \u00d7 $0.24 = $840\n     - Total incremental cash outflow (compared to receiving same volume from primary at $13.40 and $0.36 freight) \u2248 $6,475\n   - Effect: can ship within 72 hours \u2192 arrival in time for the promotion \u2192 directly reduces promotion-period shortfall and prevents large stockout penalties.\n   - Carrying cost: if an average of 10 days held before sale: 3,500 \u00d7 $0.008 \u00d7 10 \u2248 $280 (small).\n\n3) Inter-warehouse transfers (to fix West-heavy backorders)\n   - Use transfers to immediately reduce West backorders (240 units). Transfer cost $0.35/unit; 3-day transit.\n   - Example: transfer 1,000 units from A\u2192B (if available) to cover early west demand.\n     - Cost = 1,000 \u00d7 $0.35 = $350\n     - Transfer capacity 1,200/day sufficient to move this in one day.\n\nCost/benefit calculation (recommended package vs doing nothing)\n- If we do nothing, estimated stockout penalty through the promotion era \u2248 $46,852 (based on projected demand and available inbound).\n- Recommended immediate actions (combined):\n  a) Place an immediate order with Midwest GaN for 3,500 units (arrive within 72 hours). Incremental cost \u2248 $6,475 (extra unit cost + freight).\n  b) Expedite primary PO for the full 3,000-unit expedite slot to 10/27. Incremental expedite cost \u2248 $202.\n  c) Execute a targeted transfer (e.g., 1,000 units from A to B) to fix west backorders and local demand: cost \u2248 $350.\n- Total incremental near-term cash outlay \u2248 $6,475 + $202 + $350 = $7,027 (well within the $28,000 expedite budget).\n- Rough avoided stockout penalty: If domestic buy (3,500) + in-transit (2,400) + on-hand (2,800) + expedited 3,000 arriving 10/27 reduces the promotional/near-term shortfall by an estimated 6,500\u20137,500 units (conservatively estimate we avoid at least 3,500\u20136,000 stockout units during the critical window). Conservatively using 3,500 units avoided \u00d7 $6.50 penalty/unit = $22,750 penalty avoided. Net benefit \u2248 $22,750 \u2212 $7,027 \u2248 $15,723 (conservative). If avoided units are higher (likely), benefit scales up substantially.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Buying domestic increases unit cost (less margin) and creates a bit more early inventory to carry, but it directly prevents high stockout penalties and reputational/SLA failures during a high-visibility promotion.\n- Expediting the primary PO is cheap on an absolute freight basis (premium applies to $0.36 base line-haul), but the expedited ETA (10/27) misses most of the promotion \u2014 so expediting alone is not a sufficient fix for the immediate promotional risk.\n- Transfers are low cost and should be used to correct location imbalances; transfers do not increase total supply.\n\nRecommendation (clear action with quantities, timing, and expected costs/benefit)\n1. Do NOT rely on a single action of expediting only the primary PO to solve the promotion gap. Expediting alone (arrival 10/27) is too late for the 10/20\u201310/25 promotion and would leave a large penalty exposure.\n2. Immediately place a purchase with Midwest GaN for 3,500 units (ship-ready within 72 hours). Rationale: this is the fastest reliable way to get inventory into the network for the promotion. Expected incremental cost \u2248 $6,475 (extra unit cost + freight). This action directly reduces promotion shortfall and is projected to avoid tens of thousands in stockout penalties; net benefit is strongly positive.\n3. Immediately request the full available expedited slot on the primary PO for 3,000 units (move those 3,000 to 2025-10-27). Incremental cost \u2248 $202. Rationale: cheap insurance to reduce post-promo shortfall and to hedge against extended supplier delay given the severe winter/front and reduced border capacity.\n4. Execute targeted inter-warehouse transfers to address the West-heavy backorders now (e.g., transfer 1,000 units from A\u2192B). Cost \u2248 $350. Fill the 240-unit existing backorders first and then use transfers to support early-W region demand during the promotion.\n5. Monitor daily sell-through during the promo and be ready to:\n   - Increase domestic buys up to the supplier cap (3,500) if sell-through exceeds projections.\n   - Only after these measures are firm, reconsider additional expedited volume if marketplace SLAs still look at risk.\n\nQuantified expected outcome (conservative)\n- Total incremental near-term outlay for the package \u2248 $7,027.\n- Conservative avoided stockout penalty estimate \u2248 $22,750 (likely higher). Net expected savings \u2248 $15k+, with upside because each stockout avoided saves $6.50 and prevents SLA/marketplace penalties or lost customers.\n- Carrying cost impact is small (order-of-hundreds of dollars) compared with avoided stockout costs.\n\nRisks and uncertainties\n- Demand volatility: the promo could be at the high end (+20%) or low end (+10%). If the promo is stronger than modeled, even the combined actions may not fully prevent all stockouts \u2014 monitor real-time sales and be prepared to buy additional domestic supply if available.\n- Supplier reliability and border/weather: primary supplier reliability = 0.83; further delays beyond 11/07 are possible \u2014 expedite helps but not guaranteed to prevent downstream shortages if the supplier cannot fulfill. Domestic supplier availability cap (3,500 units) is a hard limit.\n- Transit timing: Midwest GaN promised 72-hour ship readiness; actual transit to sites may slip due to carriers or winter weather; plan for potential 1\u20132 day slippage.\n- Budget and margin: higher unit cost from domestic supplier reduces margin; finance must accept the trade for service continuity.\n\nBottom line\n- Do not rely on primary PO expedite alone \u2014 it\u2019s too late for the promotion.\n- Immediately procure the maximum practical short-term domestic supply (3,500 units) to cover the promotion and avoid high per-unit stockout penalties; simultaneously take the inexpensive expedite slot for 3,000 units from the primary PO to shore up post-promo availability and hedge supplier risk; use transfers to correct the west imbalance now.\n- Estimated incremental cost \u2248 $7,027 vs a conservative avoided penalty of \u2248 $22,750 \u2014 net positive and within the $28k expedite budget.",
