Backorders = 150 units.\n- Delayed container: PO#91334 with 8,000 units now ETA 2025-09-15 (original ETA 8/28).\n- Air option: can pull up to 4,000 units from that container and deliver to Newark by 2025-08-29 at a 25% premium over ocean freight ($1.10 \u00d7 1.25 = $1.375 \u2192 incremental premium = $0.275/unit).\n- Alternate supplier Juarez Textiles: up to 5,000 units, 10-day lead time (arrive \u2248 8/30 if ordered now), unit cost $32.78 (15% higher than $28.50; incremental cost = $4.28/unit); MOQ 2,500.\n- Demand calculation (using context numbers):\n  - Base weekly forecast = 2,500\n  - Trend +15% \u2192 2,875\n  - Seasonality \u00d71.25 \u2192 3,593.75 units/week \u2248 513.39 units/day\n  - Promotion (first week of September) adds +25% \u2192 promotion week demand \u2248 4,492 units\n  - Demand split: 70% Northeast, 30% Southeast\n- Critical horizon: 8/20 \u2192 9/15 (26 days). Cumulative demand from 8/20 through 9/14 = 14,246.6 units (includes the promotion week). We must cover this until the delayed container arrives on 9/15.\n\nKey Factors\n- Major driver: the promotion (Sep 1\u20137) and strong seasonality/trend drive a short, very high demand spike.\n- Timing: air arrives 8/29 (in time for promotion); Juarez arrives \u2248 8/30 (in time).\n- Capacity: air cap = 4,000 units; Juarez cap = 5,000 units (MOQ 2,500).\n- Costs:\n  - Unit cost (current/ocean-sourced): $28.50\n  - Juarez incremental unit cost: +$4.28 \u2192 $32.78\n  - Air freight incremental premium: $0.275/unit (over ocean) \u2192 air freight incremental for 4,000 = $1,100\n  - Carrying cost: $0.015/unit/day (small but included)\n  - Stockout penalty: $15/unit lost\n- Operational constraint: container limited to 8,000 units; air can pull up to 4,000 from it.\n\nCost Analysis (numbers rounded to nearest $)\nBaselines and totals\n- Demand (8/20\u20139/14) = 14,246.6 units\n- Current on-hand = 3,700 \u2192 if we do nothing, cumulative shortage until 9/15 = 14,246.6 \u2212 3,700 = 10,546.6 units\n- Stockout penalty if do-nothing = 10,546.6 \u00d7 $15 = $158,199\n\nIncremental carrying assumptions (used below)\n- Air arrives 8/29 and will be held up to 9/15 (\u224817 days).

The best pure cost outcome in the modeled horizon is air (4k) + Juarez (5k) \u2192 total incremental \u2248 $47.9k. This combination both reduces stockouts dramatically and keeps incremental transport + unit-cost increases modest relative to lost-sales avoided.\n- A pragmatic compromise is air (4k) + Juarez (3k) \u2192 total \u2248 $68.9k; this already prevents running out during the promotion week and substantially lowers total stockout penalty vs smaller buys.\n- Note: Small carrying costs (~$600\u2013$1,200) were included; these are minor.\n\nOperational / timing notes\n- Promotion week (Sep 1\u20137) demand = ~4,492 units. Because consumption from 8/20\u21928/31 is heavy (6,160 units), the effective inventory position on Sep 1 depends on shipments arriving before then.\n  - Air (arrive 8/29) and Juarez (arrive \u22488/30) both arrive before the promotion week; they therefore directly protect promotion sales.\n  - To avoid any stockouts during the promotion week you need ~6,953 units to arrive before Sep 1 (calculation in analysis). Air (4,000) + Juarez (\u22653,000) meets that threshold (Juarez 3k + air 4k \u2248 7k).\n- Inter-warehouse transfer (Atlanta \u2192 Newark): you can move the 1,500 Atlanta units to Newark (2 days, $0.85/unit = $1,275). Transfers do not change total supply; they only reallocate inventory by geography. If you expect to prioritize Northeast promotion, transferring some or all of the 1,500 can be considered \u2014 but if you plan to air/juarez shipments into Newark, the transfers are often unnecessary (they add $1,275 and do not reduce aggregate stockouts). Recommendation below clarifies this.\n\nRecommendation (clear, actionable)\n1. Immediate actions (order/commit within 24 hours)\n   - Expedite by air up to the available 4,000 units from the delayed container to Newark (arrival 2025-08-29). Incremental premium ~ $1,100 total.\n   - Place an urgent order with Juarez Textiles for at least 3,000 units (arrive ~8/30). If budget/working capital allows, place the full 5,000-unit order. Rationale:\n     - Juarez 3,000 + air 4,000 removes promotion-week stockout risk and reduces total expected cost meaningfully (modeled total \u2248 $68.9k).\n     - Juarez 5,000 + air 4,000 gives the lowest modeled expected cost until 9/15 (~$47.9k) and is the conservative option if minimizing lost sales is the primary objective.\n2. Inventory positioning\n   - Direct both the air and Juarez shipments to Newark so promotion demand (70% of total) is prioritized. Do NOT immediately transfer the 1,500 Atlanta units unless you see shortfalls in Northeast inventory between now and arrival of these shipments; transferring Atlanta stock costs $1,275 and does not change aggregate supply \u2014 it only sacrifices Southeast availability.\n3. Fill existing backorders (150 units) from current on-hand immediately.\n4. Monitor and confirm: ensure customs/clearance for air pull is handled quickly; confirm Juarez lead time and production slot; secure written confirmation of the air slot to avoid losing the 4,000 capacity.\n\nQuantified trade-offs / financial impact (summary)\n- Do nothing: expected stockout penalty \u2248 $158k (no incremental purchase/transport costs).\n- Air-only (4k): total incremental \u2248 $100k (stockout penalty + air premium + carry).\n- Juarez-only (5k): total incremental \u2248 $106k.\n- Air (4k) + Juarez (3k): total incremental \u2248 $69k (recommended compromise; eliminates promotion-week stockout).\n- Air (4k) + Juarez (5k): total incremental \u2248 $48k (best in modeled horizon if budget permits).\n\nRisks and sensitivities\n- Juarez lead-time or production risk: if Juarez slips past 8/30, promotion protection is lost. Mitigation: confirm slot, place deposit.\n- Air capacity risk: air forwarder capacity may be constrained; confirm and book immediately.\n- Container extraction: air option depends on ability to pull units from the congested container; ensure port access/clearance.\n- Forecast/penalty assumptions: the $15/unit stockout penalty is an input proxy; if actual lost-margin or lifetime value of a lost customer is higher, aggressive buying (Juarez 5k+air) becomes even more attractive.\n- Demand uncertainty: if demand is higher than modeled (trend or promotion stronger), larger buys are safer.\n- Budget / cashflow: Juarez increases unit cost and working capital; evaluate cash/finance constraints.\n\nBottom line (one-sentence)\nBook the air pull for 4,000 units immediately and place an urgent Juarez order for at least 3,000 units (ideally 5,000 if budget allows). This combination protects the promotion, materially reduces expected stockout penalties, and is the most cost-effective way to bridge the delay until the container arrives on 9/15.",
