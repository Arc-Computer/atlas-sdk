  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Warehouse A (Savannah): 25,000 units of AP-JNS-SKNY-28 (62.5% utilized of 40,000 cap). After sending 6,000 units it would hold 19,000 (47.5% util).\n- Warehouse B (Allentown): 5,000 units (16.7% utilized of 30,000 cap). Receiving 6,000 \u2192 11,000 units (36.7% util).\n- Demand signals: baseline forecast 15,000 wk, trend +18% and seasonality 1.9 \u2192 implied weekly demand = 15,000 * 1.18 * 1.9 = 33,630 units (useful as a relative indicator: strong demand/peak season).\n- Timing: catalog drops in 5 days (major demand spike). First two weeks of sales are high-value \u2014 stock arriving after two weeks likely needs a 30% markdown. Next import for Allentown in 11 days (not immediate); rail 5\u20136 days (tight capacity); FTL 2 days (available quote).\n- Transport quotes and needs: Dry-van spot = $4,200/FTL (current). Last month $3,600 \u2192 premium \u2248 16.5%. 3 FTLs required for 6,000 units (2,000 units/FTL). Total FTL cost = 3 * $4,200 = $12,600.\n- Cost parameters: carrying cost = $0.03/unit/day. Stockout penalty = $12/unit. Unit cost = $22.50.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\n- Immediate need to have inventory in Allentown prior to catalog drop (5 days) to capture peak full-price demand.\n- FTL gets inventory there in 2 days (meets catalog), rail (5\u20136 days) is borderline and capacity/unreliability risk is higher.\n- Monetary trade-offs: modest incremental freight premium vs high per-unit stockout penalty and potential lost full-price sales.\n- Operational feasibility: Savannah has capacity/headroom to pull 6k; Allentown can receive 6k easily. Truck capacity in Southeast is tight post-hurricane \u2014 confirm booking quickly.\n\nCost Analysis (numbers)\n\n1) Transport cost\n- FTL total = 3 * $4,200 = $12,600.\n- Baseline (last month) cost would have been 3 * $3,600 = $10,800. Premium paid = $12,600 - $10,800 = $1,800.\n- Per-unit freight (FTL) = $12,600 / 6,000 = $2.10 per unit.\n- Per-unit premium = $1,800 / 6,000 = $0.30 per unit.\n\n2) Carrying cost in transit (2 days)\n- 6,000 units * 2 days * $0.03/day = $360 (or $0.06/unit).\n\n3) Incremental immediate cost to move 6,000 now:\n- Total incremental cash = transport $12,600 + transit carrying $360 = $12,960.\n\n4) Stockout avoidance value\n- Given stockout penalty = $12/unit, every unit that would otherwise be out-of-stock and is instead available saves $12.\n- If all 6,000 units are sold (or avoid stockout), avoided penalty = 6,000 * $12 = $72,000.\n\n5) Break-even point\n- Incremental cost $12,960 / $12 per-unit stockout penalty = 1,080 units.\n- So if at least 1,080 of the 6,000 units are sold (or would have caused stockouts), the move pays for itself versus incurring stockout penalties.\n\n6) Per-unit economics summary\n- Cost to move per unit (FTL + carrying) \u2248 $2.16 ($2.10 + $0.06).\n- Avoided stockout penalty per unit = $12.00 \u2192 5.6x benefit per unit if that unit prevents a stockout.\n\nTrade-offs / Conflicting priorities\n- Paying the premium preserves high-margin, time-sensitive sales (catalog drop) but uses 6k units that otherwise sit in Savannah (possible future needs there).\n- Rail is cheaper (example container $3,500) but transit 5\u20136 days is borderline for catalog timing and capacity is uncertain \u2014 risk of arriving after catalog spike or being delayed.\n- Holding inventory in Savannah keeps float and simplifies network balancing; moving it secures immediate sell-through in Allentown.\n\nRecommendation (clear action + quantified benefit)\n1) Execute the 3 FTL pulls (pay the 16.5% spot premium) to move 6,000 units Savannah \u2192 Allentown now.\n   - Cost: $12,600 freight + $360 transit carrying = $12,960 total.\n   - Rationale: You need inventory present in Allentown before the catalog drop in 5 days. Even conservatively, you only need ~1,080 of these units to sell at full price (or avoid stockouts) to cover the incremental cost. Given the very strong seasonality (factor 1.9) and positive trend (+18%), it is highly likely that many more than 1,080 units will be demanded in the catalog window.\n   - Net upside example: If 50% of the moved units (3,000) are sold during the critical period, avoided stockout penalty = 3,000 * $12 = $36,000 \u2192 net benefit \u2248 $36,000 - $12,960 = $23,040 (plus incremental margin from full-price sales).\n\n2) Operational steps\n   - Book the 3 FTLs immediately and confirm pickup within 48 hours. Given tight Southeast capacity, book and confirm carrier cancel/force majeure terms.\n   - Notify Allentown receiving to prioritize these inbound FTLs for rapid putaway and store/catalog staging.\n   - Hold 1\u20132 truck slots as contingency in case a truck cancels (carrier reliability risk).\n\n3) Contingency / hybrid option (if you want to reduce cost or exposure)\n   - Move 2 FTLs (4,000 units) now and attempt to secure rail for the 3rd load (if rail can guarantee arrival by catalog/within a day or two of catalog, else FTL is safer). Economics remain strongly positive: one FTL (2,000 units) avoided stockout value = 2,000 * $12 = $24,000 vs per-FTL freight $4,200.\n\nRisks / Uncertainties\n- Actual local demand distribution: the 33,630/week network-level implied demand may not translate fully to Allentown; if Allentown demand is much lower, fewer units will sell and ROI diminishes.\n- Carrier cancellations or delays because of tight capacity post-hurricane; book with confirmed carrier and consider penalty/guarantee terms.\n- Moving inventory from Savannah could create shortages in Savannah if regional demand surges there \u2014 monitor sales velocity and be prepared to re-balance.\n- If catalog orders don\u2019t convert as expected, some units may not sell and could reduce margin; however break-even is low (~1,080 units), so modest conversion still justifies the move.\n- Markdowns: if any moved stock still ends up being sold later at markdown (if campaign length/behavior differs), that reduces benefit. But FTL arrival before catalog minimizes markdown risk for the crucial early window.\n\nBottom line\n- The incremental cost to move 6,000 units by FTL ($12,960 total; $2.16/unit) is small relative to the $12/unit stockout penalty and the high expected demand around the catalog drop. You only need ~1,080 of the 6,000 to be sold to cover the cost. With seasonality and the catalog timing, moving the 6,000 units via the 3 FTLs now is the economically prudent, low-risk action to capture full-price sales and avoid stockouts. Proceed to book the trucks immediately and confirm receipts at Allentown.",
