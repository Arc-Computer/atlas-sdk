  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Warehouse A (Lakeland, FL): capacity 225,000 cases, on-hand 193,500 cases (utilization 86%). Incoming CPG-SNCK-CHIP-BBQ PO = 18,000 cases (~300 pallets) due in 3 days. A soda promo inbound (BEV-SODA-PROMO-24PK) of 200,000 cases arrives in 4 days and requires the automated conveyor for putaway. Receiving the chips requires manual dock activity that blocks the conveyor for a full 8\u2011hour shift during the soda arrival window. If the soda is delayed, the company incurs an $80,000 co\u2011op advertising penalty.\n- Warehouse B (Kansas City, MO): capacity 160,000, on-hand 129,600 (utilization 81%). AS/RS down for 3\u20135 days, inbound processing backlog ~36 hours. Diverting the 18,000-case shipment to B would add 3 days transit and a 17.5% transport premium. Base inter-DC transport = $1.40/case.\n- Demand: forecast weekly 7,000 units; actual trend +15% and seasonality 1.4 \u2192 expected weekly demand = 7,000 \u00d7 1.15 \u00d7 1.4 = 11,270 cases/week (\u22481,610 cases/day). Regional split SE/Central = 50/50 \u2192 ~5,635 cases/week per region (\u2248805 cases/day per region).\n- Cost parameters: transport premium 17.5%, carrying cost $0.115 per case/day, stockout penalty $20.40 per case, unit cost $19.20.\n\nKey Factors\n- Immediate operational conflict at A: chips unload (manual) blocks automated conveyor needed for soda putaway \u2192 guaranteed $80,000 penalty if soda delayed.\n- Incremental cost to divert (transport premium + added transit days carrying cost) is relatively small vs the $80k penalty.\n- Risk at B: AS/RS outage, 36\u2011hour backlog, utilization would rise to ~92% \u2192 higher staging/damage/delay risk.\n- Stockout risk in Southeast if A loses inbound replenishment and lacks SKU-level safety stock. Break-even stockout quantity where diversion becomes worse than the $80k penalty must be computed.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified)\n1) Transport (incremental) for diverting 18,000 cases\n- Base inter-DC transport = $1.40/case \u2192 base cost = 18,000 \u00d7 $1.40 = $25,200\n- 17.5% premium \u2192 incremental = 0.175 \u00d7 $25,200 = $4,410\n- Total transport when diverted = $25,200 + $4,410 = $29,610\n(Note: if base transport to A would also be charged, the economic comparison uses the incremental premium $4,410.)\n\n2) Additional carrying cost (3 extra days in transit)\n- Carrying = $0.115/case/day \u00d7 3 days \u00d7 18,000 = $6,210\n\n3) Expected handling/damage risk at B (estimated)\n- Conservative estimate: 0.5\u20131.5% extra damage risk while staged / manual handling. Use 1% for planning:\n- Damage cost \u2248 1% \u00d7 18,000 \u00d7 $19.20 = $3,456\n\n4) Total incremental/diversion cost (mid estimate)\n- Incremental transport premium $4,410 + extra carrying $6,210 + estimated damage $3,456 = $14,076\n- If you include the full transport bill as incremental, total would be $29,610 + $6,210 + $3,456 = $39,276.\n\n5) Cost of not diverting (primary / quantifiable)\n- Missed promotional launch penalty = $80,000 (explicit in notes)\n- Additional potential costs if you attempt to process both: overtime, rushed manual workaround, possible damage to soda pallets \u2014 not quantified but likely positive.\n\n6) Stockout breakeven (diversion makes sense unless SE stockout cost exceeds $80k)\n- Stockout penalty per case = $20.40 \u2192 break-even stockout units = $80,000 / $20.40 \u2248 3,921 cases.\n- SE daily demand \u2248 805 cases/day \u2192 3,921 cases \u2248 4.9 days of SE demand.\n- Interpretation: if diverting causes > ~4.9 days of unmet demand in the Southeast, the stockout penalty would exceed the $80k ad penalty you avoid.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Keep at A: avoid transfer premium and added transit time, but very likely cause an $80k promotional penalty (and potentially larger downstream retail/brand impacts). Minimal added transport/carrying cost but severe contractual/marketing cost.\n- Divert to B: pay modest incremental transport/carrying/damage costs (~$14k\u2013$39k depending on accounting) and accept higher processing risk at B (backlog, damage), but avoid the guaranteed $80k soda penalty.\n- Risk balance hinges on actual SKU-level on-hand at A: if A has \u2265 ~3,900\u20134,000 cases of this SKU available to cover ~5 days of SE demand, diversion is clearly preferable; if A has substantially less buffer, diversion could produce stockout costs that exceed the advertising penalty.\n\nRecommendation (clear action + numbers)\nPrimary recommendation: Divert the full 18,000-case shipment to Warehouse B via expedited transport this week.\n\nWhy:\n- Quantified incremental cost of diversion (reasonable estimate) \u2248 $14,076 (incremental premium $4,410 + extra carrying $6,210 + 1% damage $3,456). Even at the high bound including full transport, carrying and damage, cost \u2248 $39,276.\n- This is materially lower than the certain $80,000 promotional penalty if chips are received at A and block the soda arrival.\n- Net avoided cost (conservative) \u2248 $80,000 \u2212 $14,076 = $65,924 (benefit). Even under the high bound \u2248 $80k \u2212 $39,276 = $40,724 net benefit.\n\nCondition and required checks:\n- Before diversion, confirm SKU-level on-hand at Warehouse A for CPG-SNCK-CHIP-BBQ. If A already holds \u2265 4,000 cases of this SKU (\u22485 days of SE demand), diversion is safe. If A has < 4,000 cases, consider the alternatives below.\n\nIf A has insufficient SKU on-hand (< ~4,000 cases) \u2014 alternative (split/divert) recommendation:\n- Partial diversion: Keep minimum buffer at A equal to 5 days of SE demand \u2248 805 \u00d7 5 \u2248 4,025 cases; divert the remainder (\u224813,975 cases) to B. This lowers SE stockout risk below the break-even point while still preventing conveyor conflict (estimate whether leaving ~4k cases requires a reception activity that still blocks conveyor\u2014if unloading the retained portion still takes appreciable dock time, reduce retained volume further until unloading/putaway no longer conflicts).\n- If partial receipt at A still requires the 8\u2011hour blocking shift, then full diversion is the only viable option to avoid the soda penalty.\n\nOperational mitigations if diverting\n- Pre-assign extra manual labor and forklifts at Warehouse B to reduce the 36\u2011hour backlog and lower damage risk.\n- Arrange temporary racking or covered staging to reduce dock dwell damage.\n- Flag the diverted SKU for high-priority putaway when B\u2019s AS/RS returns to reduce the time on dock.\n- Pre-plan expedited cross-dock shipments from B to SE if SE shows stock depletion; negotiate the quickest lanes and allocate budget for any additional cross-dock premium.\n\nRisks and uncertainties\n- SKU-level on-hand at A is unknown: if A lacks the ~4k case buffer, diversion could trigger >~3,921 unit stockouts in SE and incur >$80k in stockout penalties.\n- Warehouse B\u2019s AS/RS outage and backlog increase the probability of damage, mis-picks and longer-than-expected delays; damage could be >1% (we used 1% estimate).\n- Transit timing assumptions: diversion adds 3 days in transit; any additional delays increase carrying costs and delay ability to rebalance later.\n- Supplier reliability (0.82) and lead time (12 days) mean replacement replenishment is not immediate if both DCs have low stock.\n- Unmodeled costs (overtime, emergency MHE rental, retailer relationship effects beyond $80k) could change the economics.\n\nAction items (immediate)\n1. Confirm SKU-level on-hand of CPG-SNCK-CHIP-BBQ at Warehouse A right now. If on-hand \u2265 4,000 cases \u2192 proceed with full diversion to B.\n2. If on-hand < 4,000 cases, compute required retained quantity (min ~5 days demand = ~4,025 cases) and evaluate whether retaining that quantity creates the conveyor conflict. If not, partial diversion as described.\n3. If diverting, authorize expedited routing to B and allocate contingency funds ~$40k for incremental transport, carrying and damage mitigation (we estimate $14k likely, up to $39k worst-case).\n4. Mobilize extra manual labor/quality checks at B and notify retail partner of contingency handling to avoid further penalties.\n\nBottom line\n- Economically and operationally, diverting the 18,000-case shipment to Warehouse B is the preferred action unless Warehouse A currently has fewer than ~3,900\u20134,000 cases of this SKU on-hand. The avoided $80,000 advertising penalty strongly outweighs the expected incremental diversion cost (~$14k mid estimate; up to ~$39k conservative). Confirm SKU-level on-hand at A immediately; if insufficient, either divert fully or divert enough to avoid blocking the conveyor for the soda arrival.",
