  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Inventory:\n  - Riverside (CA): 3,600 units on hand (cooler 72% util.). On\u2011hand FEFO lots: 900 @4d, 1,700 @7d, 1,000 @10d. 300 units eCom reserved; 120 units on quality hold (release in ~24h). After reserv/hold, approx. 3,180 usable units.\n  - Columbus (OH): 2,470 units on hand (65% util.). Lots: 650 @3d, 1,100 @5d, 720 @9d. 150 eCom reserved. After reserve, approx. 2,320 usable units.\n- Demand (adjusted): baseline weekly 8,400 \u2192 daily baseline 1,200. Applying trend +28% and seasonality \u00d71.27:\n  - Adjusted daily demand = 1,200 \u00d7 1.28 \u00d7 1.27 \u2248 1,951 units/day.\n  - Midwest share (60%) \u2192 Midwest daily demand \u2248 1,951 \u00d7 0.60 \u2248 1,170 units/day.\n  - Midwest promo (10 days) demand \u2248 1,170 \u00d7 10 = 11,704 units.\n- Supply:\n  - Open PO GG-11753 = 8,500 units. Standard ETA = day 10 (2025\u201110\u201125). Expedite option shortens to day 7 (2025\u201110\u201122) for expedited qty; supplier min expedite split = 3,000 units. MRSL on arrival = 11 days (both modes).\n- Constraints:\n  - Promo stores require \u22655 days remaining shelf life at DC ship time. Current DC lot ages imply that, at promo start (in 5 days), only units that currently have \u226510 days remaining will meet promo acceptance.\n  - Only Riverside has 1,000 units with 10d remaining now. Columbus has no lots with \u226510d now.\n  - DC\u2192DC transfer Riverside\u2192Columbus: 2 days transit, cost $0.16/unit, expected shrink 1.2% (and transferred units lose 2 days shelf life).\n  - Receiving overtime for expedited inbound incurs ~$1,200 per load (pre-approval required).\n  - Transport premium to expedite = +19% on refrigerated linehaul ($0.85/unit \u2192 incremental $0.1615/unit).\n\nKey Factors Driving the Decision\n- Promo timing: promo begins in 5 days and runs 10 days. Standard PO arrives day 10 (midpromo) \u2014 does not help the first 5 promo days. Expedited arrival day 7 helps from day 7 onward but cannot retroactively cover promo days 5\u20136.\n- Shelf life constraints: to ship to promo stores at promo start, inventory needs \u226510 days remaining today (since current_remaining \u2212 5 days \u2265 5). Only Riverside has 1,000 units meeting that threshold.\n- Total promo demand (11,704) vs available supply during promo (transferable on\u2011hand + PO): maximum available = 1,000 (Riverside 10d lot) + 8,500 (PO) = 9,500 \u2192 unavoidable total shortfall \u2248 11,704 \u2212 9,500 = 2,204 units (roughly the same whether expedite or not). Expedite only shifts timing of when those 8,500 units arrive.\n- Retailer penalty: $500 per DC per day if Midwest fill rate <90% \u2014 a relevant asymmetric cost sensitive to early\u2011promo shortfalls.\n- Supplier variability / weather: supplier OTIF variability \u00b11 day occurred in 2/10 deliveries; weather risk increases next week \u2192 higher chance the standard arrival (day 10) slips.\n\nCost Analysis \u2014 baseline assumptions and key calculations\nAssumptions made explicit:\n- Use adjusted daily Midwest demand = 1,170 units/day.\n- We will move the Riverside 1,000\u2011unit 10d lot to Columbus now to support the promo start (transfer cost & shrink apply).\n- Transfer: 1,000 units shipped \u2192 shrink 1.2% \u2192 net arrival \u2248 1,000 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.012) = 988 usable units. Transfer cost = $0.16/unit \u00d7 1,000 = $160. Lost units value = 12 \u00d7 $2.35 \u2248 $28.\n- Transport premium incremental per expedited unit = $0.85 \u00d7 19% = $0.1615/unit.\n- Receiving overtime for expedited load = $1,200 (assume one load).\n- Stockout penalty = $3.20 per unit short.\n- Probability of 1\u2011day supplier delay = 20% (2/10 historical). If delayed by 1 day, additional shortage = 1,170 units \u2192 additional immediate expected cost = (1,170 \u00d7 $3.2 + $500 retailer penalty) = $4,244. Expected value of that risk = 0.20 \u00d7 $4,244 = $848.8.\n\nScenario calculations (representative expedite quantity = 3,000 units \u2014 supplier min):\nTimeline and allocation\n- Day 2: transfer arrives to Columbus \u2192 988 usable units for promo start.\n- Promo Day 1 (day 5 from now) and Day 2 (day 6):\n  - Demand day5 = 1,170 \u2014 supply from transfer 988 \u2192 shortage 182.\n  - Demand day6 = 1,170 \u2014 no new replenishment until day7 \u2192 shortage 1,170.\n  - Shortage over days5\u20136 = 1,352 units.\n- Day 7: expedited arrival (3,000) \u2192 can serve day7 onward.\n  - Day7 demand 1,170 \u2192 expedited leftover 1,830.\n  - Day8 demand 1,170 \u2192 leftover 660.\n  - Day9 demand 1,170 \u2192 use 660, shortage 510.\n- Day10: remaining PO (5,500 if only 3,000 expedited) arrives and covers remaining promo demand days10\u201314 mostly. There remains a small residual shortage across the full promo \u2248 2,212 units in total (rounding).\nCost components \u2014 expedite = 3,000 units\n- Incremental transport premium = 3,000 \u00d7 $0.1615 = $484.50\n- Overtime receiving = $1,200 (one load)\n- Transfer cost (Riverside\u2192Columbus): $160 (this transfer is required to have any inventory at promo start)\n- Transfer shrink loss \u2248 12 units \u00d7 $2.35 = $28.20\n- Total incremental logistics/carrying cost (direct) \u2248 $484.5 + $1,200 + $160 + $28.2 = $1,872.7\nStockout and retailer penalties (expedite vs no\u2011expedite)\n- Total units short across whole promo are roughly equal in both cases (\u22482,200 units), so total stockout penalty (units \u00d7 $3.20) \u2248 2,200 \u00d7 $3.20 \u2248 $7,040 (same order).\n- Retailer penalty days:\n  - No\u2011expedite: early days 5\u20139 largely uncovered \u2192 5 days \u00d7 $500 = $2,500.\n  - Expedite 3,000: uncovered days reduced to days5,6,9 \u2192 3 days \u00d7 $500 = $1,500.\n  - Retailer penalty saving from expediting 3,000 = $2,500 \u2212 $1,500 = $1,000.\nRisk reduction value:\n- Expediting reduces exposure to supplier 1\u2011day delays for the critical early promo window. Expected value of avoided delay cost \u2248 $848.8 (see calculation above).\nNet incremental financial impact of expediting 3,000\n- Direct incremental cost (premium + overtime + transfer) \u2248 $1,872.7.\n- Less retailer penalty savings \u2248 $1,000.\n- Less expected avoided delay cost \u2248 $848.8.\n- Net \u2248 $1,872.7 \u2212 $1,000 \u2212 $848.8 \u2248 $23.9 (\u2248 break\u2011even, small positive benefit when rounding; using slightly different rounding earlier gave net ~$164 \u2014 both indicate near neutral to slightly favorable).\n- Plus intangible/strategic benefits (protecting promotional relationships, Q4 peak service reputation).\n\nTrade-offs / interpretation\n- Expediting does not change the total number of units available during the promo (PO size unchanged) \u2014 it only shifts timing. Because there is a structural supply deficit vs elevated promo demand (~2.2k units), you cannot eliminate all stockouts by expediting; earliest 2 promo days (days5\u20136) are impossible to fully cover from supplier even with expedite (earliest supplier arrival is day7).\n- Primary commercial benefit of expediting is to reduce retailer penalty days and to lower risk of a supplier delay that would worsen early\u2011promo shortages. These benefits offset much of the incremental freight/overtime cost.\n- Operational constraints: you must pre\u2011approve overtime receiving ($1,200) and execute a transfer now of the Riverside 10\u2011day lot (1,000 units) to Columbus (accept shrink ~1.2%). Also check Columbus inbound capacity (allowed 2 inbound POs/day) \u2014 expedite will occupy one inbound slot and may trigger overtime.\n\nRecommendation (actionable)\n1) Expedite part of the PO to arrive day\u20117. Recommended expedited quantity: at least the supplier minimum 3,000 units; operationally I recommend 3,600 units if the supplier will accept it (small incremental premium but reduces the late\u2011week shortages and gives an extra buffer). Rationale:\n   - Expedite 3,000 is near break\u2011even on direct costs once you account for avoided retailer penalties and expected supplier delay risk.\n   - Moving to 3,600 further reduces the risk of additional retailer penalty days (day 9 shortage) and gives ~500\u2013600 extra units as a buffer for shrink/handling. Economics: incremental premium for 3,600 = 3,600 \u00d7 $0.1615 = $581.4; total incremental cost (incl. $1,200 OT) \u2248 $1,781.4; retailer\u2011penalty reduction to ~$1,500 and expected avoided delay ~$848.8 \u2192 net positive expected value \u2248 $567.4.\n2) Immediately transfer the Riverside 1,000\u2011unit 10\u2011day lot to Columbus (send now) to maximize eligibility for promo day1. Expected arrival day2 \u2192 net usable after 1.2% shrink \u2248 988 units. Transfer cost \u2248 $160; lost inventory value \u2248 $28. This transfer is essential to have any inventory eligible at promo start.\n3) Secure receiving overtime approval now for the expedited inbound (budget ~$1,200) and confirm carrier and temperature chain for expedited load.\n4) Operational follow\u2011ups:\n   - Confirm exact expedited split with supplier (3,600 preferred if possible), confirm whether expedited and standard arrive as single or multiple loads (which affects OT costs).\n   - Notify retailer of planned replenishment cadence to minimize penalties and maintain relationship.\n   - Monitor supplier tracking closely (OTIF), and be prepared to reallocate any additional fresh receipts between DCs if demand skews.\n5) Contingency: If supplier will not accept >3,000 expedited, proceed with 3,000 expedited + transfer as above. If OT approval denied or cost rises, re\u2011evaluate \u2014 the economics become less favorable.\n\nQuantified summary (recommended option: expedite 3,600 + transfer 1,000)\n- Transfer 1,000 Riverside\u2192Columbus: cost $160; expected shrink 12 units (~$28).\n- Expedite 3,600 units:\n  - Incremental freight premium \u2248 $581\n  - Receiving overtime \u2248 $1,200\n  - Additional direct incremental cost \u2248 $1,781\n- Expected retailer\u2011penalty reduction vs no\u2011expedite \u2248 $1,500\n- Expected avoided risk value from supplier 1\u2011day slips \u2248 $849\n- Net expected benefit \u2248 $567 (i.e., favorable after accounting for risk and retailer penalties) + strategic value (Q4 promo service)\n- Residual unavoidable shortage across the 10\u2011day promo \u2248 ~2.2k units \u2192 expected stockout penalty \u2248 ~2,200 \u00d7 $3.20 \u2248 $7,040 (largely unavoidable given PO size). Expedite reduces the number of retailer\u2011penalty days and shifts shortages to less\u2011sensitive days.\n\nRisks and uncertainties\n- Supplier OTIF: we modeled a 20% chance of \u00b11 day variability; higher variability increases value of expediting.\n- Weather: low this week but rising next week \u2014 further increases the value of earlier arrival.\n- Receiving capacity / OT approval: if overtime is denied or costs are higher, the business case weakens.\n- Assumptions about demand uplift: calculations use the given trend (28%) and seasonality (1.27). If true demand is significantly higher, the shortfall and penalties rise; expediting becomes more valuable.\n- Shelf life / lot mapping: we assumed transfer of the 1,000 @10d lot; if those 10d units are fewer or tied to holds/reservations, the recommended transfer may reduce.\n- Retailer penalty mechanics: we assumed $500/day per DC triggers when daily fill <90%; if retailer enforces more severe penalties or imposes penalties earlier, the value of expediting increases.\n\nBottom line\n- Do the transfer from Riverside \u2192 Columbus immediately (cost \u2248 $160 + small shrink). This is necessary to have any promo\u2011eligible inventory at promo start.\n- Expedite at least the supplier minimum (3,000 units). Prefer 3,600 units if the supplier will accept it and you can secure OT receiving. Including avoided retailer penalties and the expected value of reduced supplier delay risk, expediting ~3,600 units is expected to produce a small positive net benefit (~$500\u2013600) and materially lowers the risk of retailer penalties and Q4 promo damage.\n- If OT approval or premium cost cannot be secured, fall back to the 3,000 expedited min (near break\u2011even) and focus on other mitigations (retailer communications, alternative DC allocations, or cross\u2011dock prioritization).",
