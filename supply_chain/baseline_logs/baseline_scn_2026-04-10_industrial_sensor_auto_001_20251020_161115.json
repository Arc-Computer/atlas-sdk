  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Total on-hand today (2026-04-10): 17,760 units (Detroit 8,160 / Greenville 9,600). Current WOS after OEM cut: weekly demand = 2,000 * (1 \u2212 0.40) = 1,200 units/week \u2192 on-hand = 17,760 / 1,200 = 14.8 weeks.\n- Open inbound POs:\n  - PO#SEN-9550: 4,000 units, scheduled ship from Germany 2026-04-15 (arrives mid-April).\n  - PO#SEN-9562: 4,000 units, scheduled ship 2026-04-29 (arrives late-April).\n- Warehouse capacities:\n  - Detroit capacity left = 12,000 \u2212 8,160 = 3,840 units.\n  - Greenville capacity left = 12,000 \u2212 9,600 = 2,400 units.\n  - Total immediate available capacity = 6,240 units.\n- If both POs arrive as scheduled (+8,000), incoming will exceed available capacity by 8,000 \u2212 6,240 = 1,760 units (overflow).\n- Contract constraints: no cancellation within 60 days of shipment. Defer up to 30 days via ECR but deferred units incur 3% unit price increase. Supplier LT = 28 days, reliability = 0.99.\n- Cost parameters: unit cost = $210; carrying cost = $0.08/unit/day; transport premium = 15%; stockout penalty = $1,200/unit; line-down cost = $250,000/day. Assembly requires minimum 3 WOS to avoid risk.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\n1. Capacity constraint: immediate inbound + on-hand would overflow by 1,760 units if both POs are accepted as scheduled.\n2. Large existing cushion vs demand: current WOS (14.8 weeks) >> required 3 weeks \u2192 low short-term stockout risk.\n3. Deferral cost: 3% price increase on deferred units = 0.03 * $210 = $6.30 per unit.\n4. Carrying vs overflow/external costs: carrying cost is modest ($0.08/day), but overflow/third\u2011party moves likely trigger transport premium (15%) and ad hoc storage.\n5. Stockout penalty is catastrophic ($1,200/unit and $250k/day line down) \u2014 keeps us conservative on reducing safety stock.\n6. Timing & contract: cannot cancel; can request up to 30-day deferral with ECR.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified)\nA. Deferral cost (per 4,000-unit PO):\n- 3% unit-price increase = 4,000 * $210 * 0.03 = $25,200 (per deferred PO).\n\nB. Carrying cost avoided by deferring 4,000 units for 30 days:\n- Carry/day per unit = $0.08 \u2192 30 days = $2.40 per unit saved.\n- 4,000 * $2.40 = $9,600 saved in direct carrying cost by deferring 30 days.\n\nC. Overflow / urgent handling estimate (if both POs accepted as scheduled):\n- Overflow quantity = 1,760 units.\n- If overflow requires premium handling/move (use transport premium 15% as proxy): 1,760 * $210 * 0.15 = $55,440.\n- Plus carrying while temporary-stored 30 days: 1,760 * $2.40 = $4,224.\n- Estimated overflow handling + short-term carry \u2248 $59,664.\n\nD. Comparison immediate:\n- Defer PO#SEN-9562 fully: pay $25,200 deferral premium vs estimated overflow/3rd-party cost \u2248 $59,664 \u2192 immediate net saving \u2248 $34,464.\n- Also deferral reduces immediate inventory by 4,000 units, lowering carrying cost over the month by ~$9,600 (already included separately).\n\nE. Stockout risk cost (for perspective):\n- Even a single unit stockout penalty ($1,200) greatly dominates; but given current inventory, stockout risk is extremely low in the short term. We must preserve at least 3 WOS (~3,600 units) of on-hand.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Accept both POs: avoids 3% ECR premium but forces overflow handling (estimated heavy one-time premium ~$55k+) and inflates inventory (higher carrying cost).\n- Defer one PO fully: incur $25.2k price increase but avoid overflow and reduce immediate carrying; preserves warehouse operations and avoids third\u2011party costs.\n- Partial deferral (if supplier allows splitting): could minimize price increase vs overflow \u2014 this is the lowest-cost technical solution if allowed.\n- Aggressively moving inventory out (3rd-party storage/redistribution) avoids ECR cost but likely costs more (transport premium) and operational friction.\n\nRecommendation (clear, actionable with numbers)\nPrimary recommended action (lowest expected total cost and operational risk):\n1) Issue an ECR to Sensortech AG to defer PO#SEN-9562 (4,000 units, scheduled 2026-04-29) by the maximum allowable 30 days (new ship date ~2026-05-29). Accept the 3% unit-price increase = $25,200.\n   - Rationale: avoids an estimated overflow handling cost of \u2248 $59,664 and eliminates capacity breach (net estimated savings \u2248 $34,464).\n   - Effect on inventory: only PO#SEN-9550 (4,000 units arriving 4/15) will arrive in April; vehicle consumption will reduce on-hand before PO#SEN-9562 arrives in late May, avoiding capacity overflow.\n\n2) Receive PO#SEN-9550 (4/15) as scheduled but direct receipt allocation to avoid immediate local overflow:\n   - Allocate to fill Detroit capacity first (Detroit free capacity 3,840) and remaining to Greenville (160 units) or arrange a split that leaves room in Greenville for later consumption. This makes Detroit utilization \u2248 100% (12,000 units) and Greenville \u2248 9,760/12,000 = 81.3% initially.\n   - If carrier can split at origin, direct more of PO#SEN-9550 to Detroit up to its capacity to minimize cross-dock moves.\n\n3) Negotiate partial deferral alternative (preferred if supplier allows):\n   - Request deferral of only the quantity necessary to avoid overflow (minimum ~1,760 units). If Sensortech allows partial deferral, deferring 1,760 units costs: 1,760 * $210 * 0.03 = $11,088 vs deferring full PO cost $25,200. This reduces immediate inventory and minimizes premium cost. We should formally request partial deferral as Plan B; if denied, accept full deferral of PO#SEN-9562.\n\n4) Monitoring and contingency guardrails:\n   - Maintain minimum on-hand >= 3 WOS = 3 * 1,200 = 3,600 units at all times in combined stock. Current on-hand provides ample buffer.\n   - If OEM signals rapid pull-forward with \u226528 days lead time, trigger expedited shipment (accept transport premium 15% if needed). Rationale: transporting extra units at 15% premium (per 4,000 units = $126,000) remains far cheaper than a single-day line-down ($250k/day) or stockout penalties ($1,200/unit).\n   - Re-evaluate after ECR is accepted; if supplier reliability or lead time changes, reconsider partial shipments or short-term third-party storage.\n\nQuantified cost/benefit summary\n- Cost to defer PO#SEN-9562 (4,000 units): $25,200 (3% price increase).\n- Estimated cost if do not defer and must handle overflow 1,760 units with premium handling: \u2248 $59,664 (transport premium proxy + short-term carry).\n- Net expected avoided cost by deferring: \u2248 $34,464 (plus $9,600 carrying avoidance benefit over 30 days).\n- Worst-case exposure if OEM suddenly pulls forward (no warning): we can expedite within supplier LT (28 days) with 15% transport premium; cheaper than stockout/line-down penalties.\n\nOperational steps to execute immediately\n1. Submit ECR to Sensortech AG today to defer PO#SEN-9562 by 30 days. Ask for written acceptance and confirm whether partial deferral is possible.\n2. Confirm PO#SEN-9550 routing: request explicit split to fill Detroit to capacity and remainder to Greenville (or as supplier logistics allow). Confirm ASN and timing.\n3. Hold a 7\u2011day monitoring cadence with production planning and sales customer (OEM) for any demand pull-forward signals; set trigger: if OEM signals >1,200 units/week increase with <28 days notice, prepare for expedited transport.\n4. Prepare contingency budget approvals for up to 15% transport premium if expedited shipments needed.\n\nRisks and mitigations\n- Risk: Sensortech refuses partial deferral and refuses full ECR. Mitigation: Escalate to procurement and legal; be ready to accept full arrival and rent temporary storage or pay premium handling (costs estimated above) \u2014 still worse case.\n- Risk: OEM unexpectedly pulls forward demand with insufficient notice, creating a need to expedite deferred units (15% transport premium). Mitigation: keep at least 3 WOS on-hand and use supplier reliability (0.99) to expedite within 28-day LT where possible; expedite cost is still far less than line-down losses.\n- Risk: ECR processing time delays causing shipments to move unchanged. Mitigation: fast-track ECR and obtain written supplier acknowledgement; schedule logistics team to implement redirection if ECR denied.\n\nBottom line\n- Defer PO#SEN-9562 by 30 days via ECR (cost = $25,200) and accept PO#SEN-9550 as scheduled with a controlled warehouse allocation. This avoids an immediate capacity breach, likely saves ~ $34k+ versus third\u2011party/premium handling, keeps exposure to catastrophic stockout risk negligible, and preserves flexibility to accelerate if OEM demand rebounds. If Sensortech permits partial deferral (\u22481,760 units), do that instead to further reduce premium cost (estimated $11,088).",
