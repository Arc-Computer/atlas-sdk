  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Warehouse A (Stockton): 17,280 units (72% of 24,000 cap), average age 5 days.\n- Warehouse B (Kansas City): 10,400 units (65% of 16,000 cap), average age 6 days.\n- SKU PF-ROM-12CT: 14-day shelf life; max recommended in\u2011transit 5 days.\n- Demand: baseline 14,000/week, trend +22% and seasonality 1.15 \u2192 adjusted weekly demand = 14,000 \u00d7 1.22 \u00d7 1.15 = 19,642 units/week. Regional split West 40% / Central+East 60% \u2192 KC expected weekly demand = 19,642 \u00d7 0.60 = 11,785 units/week (\u22481,683 units/day).\n- Timing constraints: Central/East ads start in 6 days; open PO to KC (8,800 units) arrives ~10 days (supplier reliability 0.88). No inbound to KC within 7 days otherwise.\n- Transport options for moving 4,000 units Stockton\u2192KC within 48 hrs:\n  - Reefer FTL: $5,880/load \u2192 2 loads = $11,760; transit 2.5\u20133 days (meets shelf\u2011life constraint).\n  - Intermodal (2 containers ~2,000 units each): $5,300/container \u2192 2 = $10,600; transit 6\u20137 days (likely violates 5\u2011day sell\u2011through requirement).\n- Costs: carrying cost $0.05/unit/day; stockout penalty $7.50/unit.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\n1. Shelf\u2011life constraint: FTL transit 2.5\u20133 days keeps average age at receipt \u2248 8 days (5 + 3), leaving \u22486 days remaining \u2014 meets requirement of \u22655 days sell\u2011through. Intermodal (6\u20137 day transit) would push age to ~11\u201312 days, leaving only 2\u20133 days \u2014 violates the 5\u2011day requirement and risks spoilage/returns.\n2. Demand spike risk: ads in 6 days + current +22% trend make KC demand high at ~11,785/week. Without replenishment KC coverage: 10,400 / 1,683 \u2248 6.2 days \u2014 borderline before ads and before PO arrival.\n3. Supplier timing and reliability: inbound PO (8,800 units) arrives ~10 days; reliability 0.88 implies a non\u2011trivial chance of delay.\n4. Cost tradeoffs: transport premium vs potential stockout penalties (and SLA breach risk).\n\nCost Analysis \u2014 concrete numbers\nA. Transfer transport cost (FTL, 2 loads)\n- Transport: 2 \u00d7 $5,880 = $11,760.\n\nB. Incremental carrying cost during transit (approx.)\n- Transit ~3 days average; carrying cost = 4,000 units \u00d7 $0.05/day \u00d7 3 days = $600.\n\nC. Total near-term incremental cost to move 4,000 units = $11,760 + $600 = $12,360.\n\nD. Stockout exposure if NO transfer (next 7 days)\n- KC demand \u2248 11,785 units/week. On-hand 10,400 \u2192 expected shortage \u2248 11,785 \u2212 10,400 = 1,385 units.\n- Expected stockout penalty \u2248 1,385 \u00d7 $7.50 = $10,387.50.\n(That is the baseline expected penalty for one week before PO arrival.)\n\nE. Break-even shortage units to justify transfer\n- Break-even units = transfer_total_cost / stockout_penalty = $12,360 / $7.50 \u2248 1,648 units.\n- Current expected shortage (1,385) is slightly below this break\u2011even. But small demand uplifts or supplier delay push shortage above break-even.\n\nF. Sensitivity: ad uplift / demand volatility\n- If ads increase KC demand by 15%: KC weekly demand = 11,785 \u00d7 1.15 = 13,553 \u2192 shortage without move = 13,553 \u2212 10,400 = 3,153 units \u2192 stockout penalty \u2248 $23,647 \u2192 clearly justifies transfer.\n- If supplier PO is delayed (12% chance), the probability\u2011weighted stockout exposure increases; the expected cost of delay alone (12% \u00d7 $10,388) \u2248 $1,247, raising the expected cost of NOT transferring.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Paying the 18.7% premium (FTL) increases immediate transport spend ($11,760) but:\n  - Meets shelf\u2011life constraint (required \u22655 days of sell\u2011through on receipt).\n  - Provides KC with ~14,400 units after transfer \u2192 cover = 14,400 / 1,683 \u2248 8.6 days \u2014 covers the ad start (day 6) and likely through until the PO arrives (~day 10).\n- Cheaper intermodal ($10,600) saves ~$1,760 vs FTL but transit 6\u20137 days would leave only ~2\u20133 days remaining shelf life \u2014 unacceptable risk for product quality and likely to cause spoilage/returns and SLA failures.\n- Doing nothing risks a baseline stockout exposure of ~$10.4k and possible SLA breach once ads start; if ads or supplier delay materialize, exposure rises sharply.\n\nRecommendation (actionable)\n1. Approve the two reefer FTL moves (pay the 18.7% premium) to transfer 4,000 units Stockton\u2192Kansas City within 48 hours.\n   - Cost: Transport $11,760 + estimated carrying during transit $600 = $12,360 total incremental.\n   - Inventory after move: Stockton = 17,280 \u2212 4,000 = 13,280 units (55.3% utilization); KC = 10,400 + 4,000 = 14,400 units (90% utilization).\n   - KC coverage post\u2011move \u2248 8.6 days (14,400 \u00f7 1,683/day) \u2014 covers ad start and bridges to supplier PO arrival.\n2. Operational steps to mitigate risks:\n   - Pull the freshest available cases from Stockton (minimize age variance). Prioritize cases with age \u22645 days.\n   - Ship as two FTLs with expected transit ~2.5\u20133 days; confirm carrier ETA and temperature logs.\n   - Notify KC receiving to prioritize cross-dock and fast putaway to accelerate sell\u2011through.\n   - Monitor supplier PO GF\u20111175 daily; if supplier confirms earlier inbound or fuels drop, consider canceling/redeploying any unshipped load (if contract allows).\n3. Contingency: If final confirmation shows the ad will not move forward or supplier guarantees early arrival within 48\u201372 hrs, cancel the second load (or reroute) to avoid excess stock at KC.\n\nQuantified rationale summary\n- Transfer cost (total) = $12,360.\n- Baseline expected stockout cost if no transfer = $10,388 (shortfall 1,385 units).\n- Break-even shortage to justify move = 1,648 units (transfer cost / $7.50).\n- Given ads starting in 6 days, historical trend +22%, and any modest uplift (>~2.2%) or a supplier delay probability (12%) the expected cost of not transferring exceeds the transfer cost. Intermodal is cheaper but fails the shelf\u2011life requirement and therefore is not a viable alternative.\n\nRisks and mitigations\n- Risk: Transit delay or spoilage (temperature excursion) \u2192 Mitigation: contract carrier with temperature monitoring and SLA, inspect on receipt.\n- Risk: Demand doesn\u2019t materialize (ads canceled) \u2192 Mitigation: ability to reallocate unsold cases back to A or to other channels; monitor ad confirmation and consider cancelling second load if ad is canceled before dispatch cutoff.\n- Risk: KC becomes highly utilized (90% after move) limiting inbound receipts \u2192 Mitigation: KC outbound capacity is 5,000/day (adequate); schedule receiving windows and prioritize fast sell\u2011through.\n- Risk: Cost overrun on carrier or demurrage \u2192 Mitigation: confirm booking terms and guaranteed linehaul.\n\nBottom line\nPay the 18.7% premium and move the 4,000 units by two reefer FTLs. The move meets shelf\u2011life constraints, materially reduces stockout and SLA risk during an ad\u2011driven demand window and supplier lead\u2011time gap, and is the operationally feasible option compared with intermodal (which is cheaper but likely not acceptable due to shelf life). The transfer cost ~$12.36k is justified given the downside risk (likely shortage, ad uplift, and supplier uncertainty).",
