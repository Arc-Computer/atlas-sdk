  "answer": "Current Situation\n- Warehouse A (Memphis): capacity 200,000 units, current inventory 150,000 (75% util). Cold-storage pallet slots = 800 (out of 800 designated cold slots?), currently 90% cold utilization. A critical cold shipment (RX-ALRG-NSPRAY) of 15,000 units arrives in 3 days and requires 150 cold-storage pallet slots and an adjacent ambient staging area for temperature validation/QC. The inbound RX\u2011VITA\u2011D3\u20115K PO (4,000 units, ~40 pallets, ambient) is scheduled to arrive in 2 days and will occupy that exact staging area.\n- Warehouse B (Denver): capacity 90,000 units, inventory 80,100 (89% util). Receiving capacity reduced by ~30% due to validation work; accepting the diverted 4,000 units would push utilization to ~93% and the receipt would likely sit ~72 hours on the dock before processing. Cold-chain validation in B does NOT affect ambient product receipt.\n- Demand: adjusted weekly demand = 1,200 * (1 + 0.05 trend) * 1.1 seasonality = 1,386 units/week (~198 units/day). Regional split: South 55% (\u2248762/wk), West 45% (\u2248624/wk).\n- Timing: inbound arrives in 2 days to A. Diverting to B adds 2 days transit + 72 hours dock wait. Supplier lead time 10 days, reliability 0.97.\n- Key risk callout: If A cannot create the required staging for the allergy spray, GMP protocol will be violated and the 15,000-unit allergy shipment (value \u2248 $750,000) is at risk. Nearby certified 3PL is fully booked.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\n1. Regulatory/quality risk at A: inability to stage the cold allergy shipment may cause loss/rejection of a $750k shipment.\n2. Incremental transport & handling cost to divert vs. cost of preserving the allergy shipment.\n3. Delay and processing constraints at B (72-hour dock wait; higher utilization).\n4. Demand split (South heavier) \u2014 diverting to West shifts inventory away from majority demand and may require later rebalancing.\n5. Inventory lead time and supply reliability: supplier can replenish in ~10 days (97% reliability) but not in time for the allergy arrival in 3 days.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified)\n\n1) Priority transport cost (diversion)\n- Base inter\u2011DC transport = $2.10 / unit.\n- Priority premium = 20.2% \u2192 unit transport = $2.10 * 1.202 = $2.5242 \u2248 $2.52\n- Total transport cost for 4,000 units = 4,000 * $2.5242 = $10,096.80 \u2248 $10,097\n\n2) Incremental carrying cost due to added delay\n- Baseline to A: arrival in 2 days and likely processed quickly.\n- Divert to B: arrival in 4 days (2 extra) + 72 hr dock wait = available after ~7 days.\n- Incremental delay = 7 - 2 = 5 days.\n- Carrying cost = $0.12 / unit / day \u2192 incremental carrying = 4,000 * $0.12 * 5 = $2,400\n\n3) Potential rebalancing cost (if South demand must be supplied from Denver)\n- If 55% of this shipment ultimately needs to serve South = 2,200 units.\n- Inter\u2011DC cost to move back (base) = $2.10/unit \u2192 2,200 * $2.10 = $4,620\n- This assumes non\u2011priority backhaul; priority would be higher. Use $4,620 as estimated additional cost.\n\n4) Total immediate/divert cost (estimate)\n- Transport + incremental carrying + likely rebalancing = $10,097 + $2,400 + $4,620 = $17,117 (~$17.1k)\n\n5) Expected cost of NOT diverting (risk to allergy shipment)\n- Allergy shipment value at risk = $750,000.\n- Let p = probability that inability to stage leads to loss/rejection of that shipment.\n- Expected loss if not diverted = p * $750,000.\n- Break-even probability where expected loss equals divert cost: p = $17,117 / $750,000 \u2248 2.28%\n  \u2192 If probability of severe loss >2.3%, diverting is economically justified.\n\nExample scenarios\n- If p = 10% \u2192 expected loss = $75,000. Net benefit of diversion = $75,000 - $17,117 = $57,883.\n- If p = 50% \u2192 expected loss = $375,000. Net benefit = $375,000 - $17,117 = $357,883.\nEven at p = 5% \u2192 expected loss $37,500 >> diversion cost \u2192 net benefit ~$20.4k.\n\nTrade-offs / Conflicting priorities\n- Pros of diverting: avoids high-probability, very high-cost regulatory/quality loss (~$750k); removes staging conflict so allergy spray can be processed; ambient product at B is safe to hold.\n- Cons of diverting: immediate outlay (~$10.1k transport + $2.4k carry + likely $4.6k rebalance = ~$17.1k); increases B utilization to ~93% and causes 72h dock delay (potential service lag for West); shifts inventory away from South demand, requiring later transfers.\n- Operational constraints: no nearby 3PL available; A has only one feasible way to clear staging (moving receiving overflow), which appears infeasible in the 2\u20133 day window.\n\nRecommendation (clear, actionable)\n1. Divert the entire 4,000-unit RX\u2011VITA\u2011D3\u20115K shipment to Warehouse B using priority transport this week.\n   - Estimated immediate cost: ~$10,100 transport + ~$2,400 incremental carrying = ~$12,500.\n   - Anticipate an additional 2,200 units (estimate) will need rebalancing later \u2192 budget ~$4,600 for backhaul (non\u2011priority), bringing a practical total ~ $17,100.\n2. Rationale: the diversion cost (~$17.1k total) is orders of magnitude smaller than the expected cost of risking the $750k allergy shipment. Unless you believe the probability of total loss is < ~2.3%, diversion is the economically correct action.\n3. Execution items (to reduce further costs/risks):\n   - Immediately notify B site to reserve dock and request priority processing to reduce the 72\u2011hour wait (could shave carrying cost and reduce service risk).\n   - Flag the inbound at B as higher priority than the \u201cthird-lowest\u201d receipt (pay small overtime/expedite to reduce processing delay).\n   - At A, concurrently attempt to clear receiving overflow (move any movable ambient pallets into short-term racking or cross-dock) as a contingency to allow late reroute back to A if B cannot process quickly.\n   - Post-arrival, monitor inventory and plan targeted backhauls only as required by South demand to minimize rebalancing cost (do not move entire lot unless needed).\n   - Document GMP rationale for diversion and keep QA/Compliance informed (this strengthens the case if regulators inquire).\n\nRisks & Sensitivities\n- Risk that B\u2019s 72\u2011hour dock wait is longer than estimated \u2014 increases carrying cost and customer service delay. Mitigation: request overtime or temporary staff to expedite.\n- Risk of future capacity crunch at B (93% util) if other shipments arrive. Mitigation: schedule picks/backhauls and prioritize shipments against demand.\n- Uncertainty in how much of the 4,000 units will be required in the South (we used 55% regional split as proxy). If considerably more needs to move, rebalancing cost rises.\n- Probability estimate of allergy shipment loss (p) is the key sensitivity. Even very small p (>2.3%) economically justify diversion.\n- Supplier replenishment (lead time 10 days) could refill A, but not quickly enough for the allergy arrival in 3 days.\n\nBottom line\nDivert the 4,000 units to Denver via priority transport. Estimated extra cost \u2248 $17.1k (transport + incremental carrying + likely rebalancing), which is small compared with the downside risk (up to $750k) of not creating staging space for the temperature\u2011sensitive allergy shipment. The decision is robust for any realistic probability of loss (> ~2.3%). Take immediate operational steps at B to minimize dock wait and at A to attempt any parallel relief of receiving overflow.",
