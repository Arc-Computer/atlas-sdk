Its cold-storage (2\u20138\u00b0C) capacity is 800 pallet slots and is currently 90% full (\u2248720 occupied, 80 free). A 4,000\u2011unit inbound ambient PO (RX\u2011VITA\u2011D3\u20115K, \u224840 pallets) is scheduled to arrive in 2 days and is planned to use the ambient staging area adjacent to cold staging. In 3 days a high\u2011priority, temperature\u2011sensitive allergy spray (RX\u2011ALRG\u2011NSPRAY, 15,000 units, requires 150 cold pallet slots) arrives requiring 150 cold staging pallet slots for temperature validation/QC. The only way to create that staging space at A is to clear the ambient staging area the vitamin shipment will occupy. If the vitamins are not diverted, the allergy shipment will lack a staging zone for GMP validation and risks compromise (shipment value \u2248 $750,000). No certified nearby 3PL capacity is available.\\n\\nWarehouse B (Denver) is at 89% utilization (80,100 / 90,000 units). B\u2019s cold\u2011chain validation is underway but does not affect ambient goods. Receiving capacity at B is reduced by ~30% during validation (docks/techs occupied). Accepting the 4,000\u2011unit diversion would push B utilization to \u224893%; the vitamin receipt would be low priority and likely sit on dock ~72 hours before processing.
