  "final_answer": "Current Situation:\n- Warehouses: Atlanta (A) = 45,000 cases on 60,000 capacity (75% util). Miami (B) = 8,000 cases on 50,000 capacity (16% util).\n- Product: VoltRush Tropical (CPG-VR-TROP-24PK), unit cost $9.80, shelf life 270 days.\n- Demand: forecast weekly 25,000 cases, trend +10% and seasonality 1.4 -> effective weekly demand = 25,000 * 1.1 * 1.4 = 38,500 cases/week -> daily demand \u2248 38,500 / 7 = 5,500 cases/day.\n- Timing: Promotion (major grocery chain 'Summer Kickoff') begins in 4 days. Miami has 8,000 cases today. Next production run of 15,000 cases scheduled in 3 days but supplier reliability = 0.82 and recent misses of 1\u20132 days.\n- Transport options: temp-controlled FTL premium quoted $3,000/load (2,000 cases/load) -> 5 loads needed for 10,000 cases -> total $15,000. Last month base $2,500/load (20% premium). Dry van option $2,200/load -> 5 loads = $11,000 but risk of product quality if trailers sit in sun.\n\nKey Factors:\n1) Immediate demand pressure: Miami has 8,000 cases -> covers H/D = 8,000 / 5,500 \u2248 1.45 days only. Without replenishment, Miami will face shortage well before the 4-day promo start.\n2) Supplier timing risk: 15,000-case production due in 3 days but 18% chance of 1\u20132 day delay; if delayed the promo start (day 4) could be missed.\n3) Stockout penalty: $5.50 per unit unsold/penalized.\n4) Transport premium: paying 20% premium raises temp-controlled FTL to $3,000/load ($1.50 per case). Dry van is $1.10 per case but has quality risk.\n5) Capacity: moving 10,000 from Atlanta reduces Atlanta utilization to (45k-10k)/60k = 58.3%; Miami utilization rises to (8k+10k)/50k = 36% \u2014 both within capacity.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified):\nAssumptions used: daily demand D = 5,500 cases/day; Miami inventory H = 8,000 cases; days to empty = H/D = 1.4545 days.\nA) Expected stockout cost if NO transfer\n- If production arrives on-time (prob 0.82) at day 3: shortage days = 3 - 1.4545 = 1.5455 days -> shortage units S_on = 1.5455 * 5,500 = 8,500 units.\n- If production delayed by avg 1.5 days (prob 0.18) => arrival day 4.5: shortage days = 4.5 - 1.4545 = 3.0455 -> S_del = 3.0455 * 5,500 = 16,750 units.\n- Expected shortage units = 0.82 * 8,500 + 0.18 * 16,750 = 6,970 + 3,015 = 9,985 units (\u22489,985).\n- Expected stockout penalty cost = 9,985 * $5.50 = $54,967.50 (~$54,968).\n\nB) Cost to transfer 10,000 cases by temp-controlled FTLs\n- Transport cost = 5 loads * $3,000 = $15,000.\n- Per-case transport = $15,000 / 10,000 = $1.50 per case.\n- Carrying cost: worst-case hold ~2 days before consumption (D uses 5,500/day -> 10,000 consumed in ~1.818 days). Using 2 days as conservative estimate: carrying cost = 10,000 * $0.02/day * 2 days = $400. (If averaged ~1 day of holding per unit, cost \u2248 $200.)\n- Total immediate cost of transfer \u2248 $15,400 (transport + carrying) using the conservative 2-day holding.\n\nC) Dry-van alternative (cheaper but quality risk)\n- Transport cost = 5 * $2,200 = $11,000 (per-case $1.10).\n- Risk: potential quality loss if sitting in sun. If we conservatively assume a 5% spoilage/damage rate from heat exposure -> 500 cases lost -> spoilage cost = 500 * $9.80 = $4,900 (product cost). This also risks stockout/retailer rejection and losing endcap \u2014 potentially similar to stockout penalty. Combining cost and risk can approach or exceed the premium.\n\nBreak-even comparison\n- Break-even stockout units avoided to justify $15,000 premium = 15,000 / 5.5 \u2248 2,727 units. Our expected shortage without transfer is ~9,985 units >> 2,727, so the premium is economically justified.\n\nTrade-offs:\n- Pay premium ($15k + small carry cost) to nearly eliminate expected stockout (~9,985 units expected short): clear immediate mitigation of losing promotion and endcap.\n- Use dry vans (save ~$4k) but accept product-quality risk and potential spoilage/rejection; this could also result in similar or larger penalty if endcap is lost.\n- Do nothing (save freight) but expect expected stockout cost \u2248 $54,968 (probability-weighted) and high risk of losing promotion/endcap \u2014 a strategic cost well above transport premium.\n\nRecommendation (clear action + quantified benefit):\n1) Yes \u2014 pay the 20% temp-controlled FTL premium and move 10,000 cases from Atlanta -> Miami in next 24 hours using the premium FTL quote ($3,000/load \u00d7 5 loads = $15,000). Add estimated carrying cost ~$400 (2 days) -> total \u2248 $15,400.\n2) Rationale: Doing the move avoids an expected stockout cost of \u2248 $54,968 (expected lost-sales/penalty). Net expected benefit \u2248 $54,968 - $15,400 = $39,568 (i.e., ~ $39.6k expected savings by preventing lost sales and protecting the promo/endcap).\n3) Operational details: Book 5 temp-controlled FTLs ASAP, try to secure 1-day transit if possible to further reduce carrying days. Notify Miami receiving and stores to prioritize putaway and endcap staging upon arrival.\n4) Contingency: If budget-constrained, the minimum safe move is the quantity required to cover through the supplier earliest expected arrival. To cover until day 3 reliably, you need to cover shortage of ~8,500 units (on-time) or up to ~16,750 (delayed). A conservative partial move would be 8,500\u201310,000; since loads are 2,000 each, moving 10,000 is the right discrete choice.\n\nRisks & Uncertainties:\n- Supplier miss could be >2 days (worse than modeled), which would increase shortage \u2014 our transfer would still cover that immediate risk but longer delays would require additional replenishment.\n- Transit uncertainty: quoted transit 1\u20132 days; if transit extends, carrying costs up slightly but still far below stockout penalty.\n- Dry-van risks (if chosen) could include product degradation, retailer rejection, or even recall \u2014 these are hard-to-quantify but could exceed the $4k nominal cost savings vs FTL.\n- Demand could spike above forecast during the promo; if demand is materially higher, even the 10k transfer + 15k production may be insufficient. Monitor sell-in closely and be prepared to expedite additional replenishment if needed.\n\nSummary (single-line decision): Pay the 20% temp-controlled premium and move 10,000 cases (5 FTLs) now. Cost \u2248 $15,000 freight + ~$400 carry \u2248 $15,400 vs expected stockout/penalty \u2248 $54,968 avoided -> expected net benefit \u2248 $39,568. This also protects the strategic outcome (endcap during the promotion).",
