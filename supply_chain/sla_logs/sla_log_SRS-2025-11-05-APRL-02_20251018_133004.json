For quantitative analyses, explicitly state assumptions, show all calculations, and include sensitivity analyses to demonstrate robustness. When operational constraints are present, develop practical, multi-pronged solutions (e.g., hybrid inventory policies, cross-docking) that respect those limits, and provide concrete, timed action steps for implementation.",

This approach reinforces precision and self-correction without needing to provide the correct answer directly."
