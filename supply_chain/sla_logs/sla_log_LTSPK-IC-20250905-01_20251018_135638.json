(Louisiana) halted by Hurricane Leo.\n- On-hand (per additional_notes): Houston = 450 units; Cleveland = 700 units; Total = 1,150 units. (Note: top-level warehouse inventory_units appear higher; use the explicit current on-hand values from additional_notes for decisioning.)\n- Demand: total forecast = 800 units/week => 114.2857 units/day. Demand split 50/50 between two OEM customers => each site consumes ~400 units/week => 57.1429 units/day each.\n- Days of supply today: Houston = 450 / 57.1429 = 7.875 days; Cleveland = 700 / 57.1429 = 12.25 days. (Both < 1.5 weeks combined; Houston critical.)\n- Gulfstream status: PO#GM-1120 for 1,500 units indefinitely delayed. Gulfstream believes they can produce & ship 500 units within 10 days, but this is not guaranteed. Base supplier lead time normally 28 days; reliability_score = 0.95 (likely degraded due to hurricane).\n- Alternate supplier: Hamburg Fluid-Technik (Germany) has 1,000 units available immediately. Unit cost = $100.30 (18% above $85). Only viable transport is international air freight cost = $12.50/unit. Standard LTL from Gulfstream would be $2.20/unit if available.\n- Cost parameters: carrying_cost_daily_per_unit = $0.02; stockout_penalty_per_unit_per_day = $250 (very large), transport_premium_pct = 40% (contextual; we use explicit freight $12.50/unit for Hamburg and $2.20/unit for Gulfstream LTL).\n\nKEY FACTORS (drivers)\n- Immediate risk: Houston will begin to face stockout in ~7.9 days. A stockout causes a production line-down with contractual penalties of $250/unit/day (capped by PO value\u2014uncertain cap impact).\n- Hamburg availability: 1,000 units immediately available; air freight is the only option (fast but expensive: landed cost per unit = $100.30 + $12.50 = $112.80).\n- Gulfstream uncertain recovery: they may deliver 500 units in ~10 days (not guaranteed). If that delivery arrives, it may prevent longer-term outages; if not, Hamburg inventory may be the only immediate source.\n- Warehouse constraints: Houston utilization 63% of 5,000 capacity; adding a small air shipment (order of ~100\u2013200 units) is feasible. Cleveland at 81%/8,000 capacity is tighter but still has 12.25 days supply and can wait.\n- Financial asymmetry: holding cost is tiny ($0.02/unit/day) vs stockout penalty $250/unit/day. This strongly biases toward preventing any stockout even if air freight is expensive.\n\nCOST ANALYSIS (quantified)\nAssumptions and conversions\n- Per-customer daily demand = 400 units/week / 7 = 57.142857 units/day.\n- Gulfstream earliest promised partial replenishment = 500 units at day 10 (uncertain). To be conservative, plan to avoid any stockout before day 10.\n- Days until Gulfstream delivery = 10 days. Houston needs supply to cover 10 days of demand.\n\n1) Units required for Houston to cover through day 10\n- Demand Houston over 10 days = 57.142857 * 10 = 571.42857 units.\n- Shortfall = 571.42857 - 450 on-hand = 121.42857 units => round up = 122 units required.\n\n2) Cost to air-freight 122 units from Hamburg to Houston (landed)\n- Hamburg landed unit cost = $100.30 + $12.50 = $112.80/unit.\n- Air freight cost for 122 units = 122 * $112.80 = $13,761.60.\n- Carrying cost (negligible): if delivered in ~3 days and consumed over the next ~8 days, additional carrying cost ~ 122 * $0.02 * average 4 days \u2248 $9.76 (negligible).\n- Total incremental cost \u2248 $13,771.36 (rounded = $13,772).\n\n3) Stockout penalty if we do NOT air freight and Gulfstream delivers 500 units at day 10\n- Houston runs out after 7.875 days, so shortage duration until arrival at day 10 = 10 - 7.875 = 2.125 days.\n- Units short per day = 57.142857; penalty/day = 57.142857 * $250 = $14,285.71/day.\n- Total penalty over 2.125 days = $14,285.71 * 2.125 = $30,357.14.\n\nComparison (to avoid the immediate Houston outage until day 10)\n- Air freight cost (122 units): ~$13,762 vs expected penalty for ~2.125-day outage: ~$30,357.\n- Net avoided cost (penalty avoided minus air cost) \u2248 $30,357 - $13,762 = $16,595 saving.\n\n4) Sensitivity: order 150 units (rounded operational order)\n- Cost = 150 * $112.80 = $16,920.\n- Penalty avoided same approximate $30,357 => net benefit \u2248 $13,437.\n\n5) Full Hamburg buy (1,000 units)\n- Cost = 1,000 * $112.80 = $112,800. This fully replaces immediate shortfall network-wide but is far larger expenditure. It would avoid larger penalties only if Gulfstream fails entirely and penalties across both customers for many days would exceed $112,800. For example, a single day full network outage of 114.2857 units/day => penalty/day = 114.2857 * $250 = $28,571.43. To justify $112,800 purely on penalty avoidance you'd need ~3.95 days of full-network outage. A targeted smaller air order is more cost-effective to protect the earliest high-risk node (Houston).\n\nTRADE-OFFS\n- Minimize cash outlay vs minimize risk of extremely costly stockout: holding cost tiny vs stockout penalty huge ($250/unit/day). This drives us to spend on expedited freight where it prevents any outage.\n- Ordering only the minimum (~122 units) reduces cost but leaves little buffer if Gulfstream delays further or doesn\u2019t deliver the 500 units. Ordering a slightly larger buffer (150\u2013200 units) increases cost modestly but reduces risk.\n- Buying the full Hamburg availability (1,000 units) is expensive ($112,800) and unnecessary if Gulfstream\u2019s 500 units arrive, but it is the safest option if Gulfstream fails entirely and penalties escalate across both customers.\n- Inter-warehouse transfers are not a primary option (both warehouses nearing critical levels). Cleveland can hold until day 12.25; avoid depleting Cleveland to save Houston unless Gulfstream fails.\n\nRECOMMENDATION (clear, actionable with numbers)\n1) Immediate action (within 0\u201324 hours): Place an air freight order with Hamburg for 150 units, deliver to Houston.\n   - Rationale: 150 units > minimum 122 units needed to cover Houston through the earliest estimated Gulfstream replenishment at day 10, providing ~28 units of buffer (~0.5 days extra). 150 units cost = $16,920 (150 * $112.80).\n   - Financials: Avoids an expected ~$30,357 stockout penalty if Gulfstream delivers at day 10; net expected immediate saving \u2248 $13,437 (30,357 - 16,920). Carrying cost negligible (~<$20).\n   - Operational: Houston capacity (5,000 units) at 63% utilization can accept +150 units easily. Transit expectation for air import: 2\u20134 days (confirm customs/clearance timing).\n\n2) Staged contingency: Do NOT immediately buy the full 1,000 units. Instead:\n   - Monitor Gulfstream status closely. Set a hard trigger at T+4 days (i.e., 4 days from now): if Gulfstream has not confirmed on-time production/shipping for the 500-unit partial PO within 4 days, place a second air order for additional units from Hamburg up to the remaining need for coverage across both warehouses.\n   - Calculation for second tranche: If Gulfstream fails entirely, network demand until replacement = assume 14 days. In that extreme scenario we would need roughly 114.2857 * 14 = 1,600 units total (we currently have 1,150) => incremental need \u2248 450 units. Hamburg can supply 1,000, so a follow-up order up to 450 units would be justified only if Gulfstream delivery fails. Cost per additional unit remains $112.80.\n\n3) Allocation logic if follow-up order needed:\n   - Prioritize Houston for immediate coverage until Cleveland approaches <7 days supply. Use the same per-customer daily demand (57.14/day) to set thresholds. Keep Cleveland at least 7 days of coverage before diverting more supply there.\n\n4) Administrative / contract steps:\n   - Expedite customs paperwork and pre-clearance to minimize transit time (reduce risk of added delay).\n   - Notify both OEM customers proactively; document steps taken to mitigate risk (may reduce contractual penalty severity or buy time).\n   - Confirm Hamburg lead time and earliest flight/cutoff; confirm no minimum order quantity blocking a small 150-unit order.\n\nRISKS & UNCERTAINTIES\n- Gulfstream delivery uncertainty: They claim 500 units in 10 days but hurricane impacts could prevent this. We assumed 10-day arrival; if it slips further, more air freight will be required.\n- Hamburg constraints: Air freight availability, customs delays, or export restrictions could extend transit beyond assumed 2\u20134 days. Confirm earliest possible transit/arrival.\n- PO cap on penalties: Contract says penalties are capped at PO value\u2014this may reduce actual penalty exposure; cap value unknown. If cap is low, economics shift slightly but not enough to avoid expedited action given $250/unit/day is large.\n- Currency, payment, and logistics: payment terms, VAT/customs duties, and airport congestion could add costs/time.\n- Inventory data sources: There is inconsistency between top-level inventory_units and additional_notes on-hand numbers. We used the explicit current on-hand per additional_notes (Houston 450, Cleveland 700). If actual on-hand is higher, adjust plan downward.\n\nWHAT I DID & RESULTS PRODUCED\n- Calculated daily demand per customer = 57.1429 units/day.\n- Calculated days of supply: Houston 7.875 days, Cleveland 12.25 days.\n- Determined required immediate air order to avoid Houston stockout until Gulfstream earliest replenishment at day 10 = 122 units.\n- Computed cost to air freight 122 units from Hamburg = $13,761.60 (landed $112.80/unit).\n- Computed penalty if no air freight and Gulfstream delivers at day 10 = ~$30,357 (penalty over ~2.125 days of outage at $250/unit/day).\n- Compared costs and concluded immediate air shipment is cost-effective; recommended ordering 150 units (operational buffer) costing $16,920 to Houston immediately.\n\nSUMMARY (concise)\n- Immediate, cost-effective action: Air freight 150 units from Hamburg to Houston now (cost $16,920). This prevents an estimated ~$30,357 in near-term penalty exposure if Gulfstream only recovers by day 10, yielding net immediate benefit \u2248 $13,437.\n- Monitor Gulfstream closely; if their 500-unit promise slips/vanishes, place a second air order (up to ~450 units more) to cover network needs\u2014threshold trigger: lack of confirmed on-time shipping within 4 days.\n\nArtifacts: null\n",
