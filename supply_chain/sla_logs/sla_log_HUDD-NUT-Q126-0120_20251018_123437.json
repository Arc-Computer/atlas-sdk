  "final_answer": "Complete inventory rebalancing analysis and recommendation for WheyPRO (WHEY-PRO-VNL-5LB) transfer (A -> B)\n\nCurrent Situation\n- Warehouse A (Seattle): utilization 95% (95,000/100,000). Congestion is blocking inbound receiving; management mandate: move 15,000 units out of A within 10 days. No further POs for 6 weeks. Post-transfer A inventory would be 80,000 units (80% utilization).\n- Warehouse B (Denver): utilization 58% (43,500/75,000). Has capacity to accept 15,000 units (post-transfer inventory 58,500 -> 78% utilization). B requires a high-altitude seal check adding $0.05/unit and a 4-hour processing delay. Transit = 3 days.\n- Product: unit cost $28, shelf life 365 days; current stock expires in 280 days, and policy requires sale >=90 days before expiry => must sell within 190 days from now.\n- Demand: company-level adjusted weekly forecast = 6,000 * (1 - 0.12) * 1.5 = 7,920 units/week (seasonal Q1 uplift applied).\n- Supplier lead time 10 days (reliable). No POs for next 6 weeks.\n- Costs: base inter-warehouse cost $0.90/unit; transport premium 18%; high-altitude handling $0.05/unit; carrying cost $0.025 per unit per day; stockout penalty $12/unit. Disposal if expired unsold = $2.50/unit.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\n- Management mandate: 15,000 units must leave A within 10 days.\n- B can accept the 15,000 units (free capacity = 31,500 units). Transit and handling fit the timing constraint (3 days transit, 4-hour processing).\n- Market opportunity: competitor stockouts in Mountain West create a short-term opportunity to capture incremental sales at B.\n- Shelf-life constraint: 15,000 units must clear well within 190-day sell window if sales are reasonably paced.\n- Costs to compare: transfer (including premium + special handling) vs incremental carrying vs avoided stockout penalties and freed capacity value at A.\n\nCost Analysis (explicit calculations)\nAssumptions used in the base calculation: moved quantity = 15,000 units; adjusted weekly demand (company-wide) = 7,920 units/week. I show two demand-share scenarios for Denver (base and conservative). Key computed values below:\n\n1) Transfer cost components (fixed):\n- Base transfer cost: $0.90 * 15,000 = $13,500\n- Transport premium (18% of base): $13,500 * 0.18 = $2,430\n- High-altitude handling: $0.05 * 15,000 = $750\n- Total transfer cost = 13,500 + 2,430 + 750 = $16,680\n- Per-unit average transfer cost = $16,680 / 15,000 = $1.112/unit\n\n2) Carrying cost estimate (depends on how fast B sells the 15k). Use weekly demand at B = p * 7,920, where p = B\u2019s share of company demand.\n\nBase scenario (B share p = 30%, plausible when competitor is stocked out locally):\n- B weekly demand = 7,920 * 0.30 = 2,376 units/week\n- Time to sell 15,000 (weeks) = 15,000 / 2,376 = 6.313 weeks => days = 6.313 * 7 = 44.19 days\n- Per-unit carrying cost until sold = $0.025/day * 44.19 = $1.1048/unit\n- Total carrying cost for 15,000 = $1.1048 * 15,000 = $16,571.70 (rounded $16,572)\n\nTotal transfer + carrying (base) = $16,680 + $16,571.70 = $33,251.70\n\n3) Avoided stockout benefit (opportunity) \u2014 base-case capture assumption:\n- Assume incremental capture due to competitor stockout = ~475 units/week in Mountain West for 8 weeks (plausible short term window)\n- Incremental units captured = 475 * 8 = 3,800 units\n- Stockout penalty avoided (proxy for margin + lost-sale cost) = 3,800 * $12 = $45,600\n\nNet financial summary (base case p=30%, incremental capture as above):\n- Avoided stockout benefit $45,600\n- Less transfer + carrying $33,251.70\n- Net benefit = $45,600 - $33,251.70 = $12,348.30 (~$0.82/unit over the moved 15,000)\n\nConservative scenario (B share p = 15%):\n- B weekly demand = 7,920 * 0.15 = 1,188 units/week\n- Time to sell 15,000 = (15,000 / 1,188) * 7 = 88.38 days\n- Per-unit carrying cost = $0.025 * 88.38 = $2.2095 => total carrying = $33,142.50\n- Total transfer + carrying = $16,680 + $33,142.50 = $49,822.50\n- If incremental capture is smaller (e.g., 225 units/week for 8 weeks = 1,800 units), avoided penalty = 1,800 * $12 = $21,600\n- Net (conservative) = 21,600 - 49,822.50 = -$28,222.50 (loss)\n\nBreakeven analysis (how many incremental units must be captured to justify the move)\n- Using base carrying cost estimate (p=30%), required avoided units U to break even: U * $12 >= $33,251.70 => U >= 2,771 units\n- If the Mountain West opportunity yields at least ~2,771 incremental sales captured by having inventory at B, transfer breaks even or better.\n- If that demand accrues over 8 weeks, required incremental capture/week >= 2,771 / 8 = 346 units/week\n\nOperational/other quantified impacts\n- Post-transfer utilizations: A = 80% (80,000/100,000); B = 78% (58,500/75,000).\n- Transit + processing: 3 days transit + 4-hour processing delay -> meets 10-day mandate comfortably.\n- Shelf-life disposal risk: negligible under base scenario (sold in ~44 days vs requirement to sell within 190 days). Disposal fee risk low.\n- Service level: adding inventory to B increases ability to hit 98% service target regionally.\n\nTrade-offs\n- Pros: Frees 15,000 units of capacity at A (relieving inbound backlog), captures short-term market-share opportunity in Mountain West, improves service at B, complies with management mandate, low expiry/disposal risk.\n- Cons: Transfer cost ($16,680) and additional carrying cost while inventory waits to sell at B. If Denver demand share is small or competitor recovers quickly, the move could be net-negative. Moving product away from A could slow fulfillment to customers normally served by A if A had higher local demand share (but utilization relief at A helps receive other fast-moving SKUs).\n\nRecommendation (clear action with quantified cost/benefit)\n1) Proceed with the 15,000-unit inter-warehouse transfer from A (Seattle) to B (Denver) if BOTH of the following operational/market conditions are true:\n   - The Mountain West regional team (sales/marketing) commits to targeted promotion / placement to capture at least ~350 incremental units/week for ~8 weeks (i.e., expected incremental capture >= ~2,770 units). Under this condition, expected net benefit \u2248 $12.3k (base case calculation).\n   - Confirm that inbound priorities at A will immediately use the freed capacity for faster-turning, high-margin SKUs, or that the operational backlog relief value (qualitative) is important to operations.\n\nRationale and quantified outcome if you proceed (base assumptions above):\n- Transfer cost: $16,680\n- Incremental carrying cost (until sold at B): ~$16,572\n- Avoided stockout / incremental sales benefit (3,800 units captured): $45,600\n- Net benefit \u2248 $12,348 (positive)\n- Per unit net \u2248 $0.82/unit over 15,000 moved\n- Post-transfer utilizations: A -> 80%, B -> 78%; transit + processing within the 10-day mandate.\n\n2) If marketing/sales cannot commit to capture >= ~346 incremental units/week (or you lack confidence in the competitor-driven demand surge), DO NOT move WheyPRO. Instead:\n   - Move a different SKU with higher short-term velocity in the Mountain West OR\n   - Move only part of the mandated 15,000 (if policy allows) and route the remainder to a third location with higher projected demand share, OR\n   - If the mandate is absolute to move 15k of anything, choose the SKU that best meets short-term demand there.\n\n3) If you proceed, execute these tactical steps:\n   - Push promotion and local merchandising in Mountain West immediately (tie-in to product availability date at B). This is necessary to realize the incremental-capture assumption.\n   - Monitor sell-through at B weekly. If incremental capture < 50% of the target after two weeks, consider redirecting any remaining inbound/more transfers to alternative channels or accelerate markdowns.\n   - Track service level and inbound backlog relief at A to quantify operational benefits realized.\n\nRisks and key uncertainties\n- Demand uncertainty: competitor stockout could resolve quickly; Mountain West uplift may be less than assumed \u2014 in that case the transfer becomes loss-making (see conservative scenario: could lose \u2248 $28k).\n- Demand allocation uncertainty: if Denver\u2019s share of demand is materially lower than assumed (<<30%), carrying cost to sell grows and viability falls.\n- Carrying-cost sensitivity: higher days-to-sale materially increases carrying cost (nearly linear with days on hand).\n- Disposal / expiry: current stock must be sold within 190 days; if sell-through stalls, disposal fees ($2.50/unit) + write-offs could be incurred.\n- Operational: routing errors, processing delays, or damage in transfer could reduce realized incremental sales.\n\nWhat I did and results produced (concise)\n- Calculated adjusted weekly demand (6,000 * 0.88 * 1.5 = 7,920 units/week).\n- Calculated full transfer cost including premium and handling = $16,680 (=$13,500 base + $2,430 premium + $750 altitude handling).\n- Modeled carrying cost for 15,000 units under base and conservative Denver demand-share scenarios and computed total carrying costs ($16,572 base; $33,143 conservative).\n- Estimated an avoided-stockout benefit scenario (3,800 incremental captured units) giving $45,600 benefit.\n- Performed breakeven analysis: need ~2,771 incremental units captured to offset transfer + carrying (\u2248346/week over 8 weeks).\n- Produced recommendation: proceed with full 15,000-unit transfer if sales/marketing can commit to at least ~350 incremental units/week capture in Mountain West; otherwise do not transfer WheyPRO (choose a different SKU to move).\n\nNumeric summary (key computed values):\n{\n  \"adjusted_weekly_demand\": 7920,\n  \"transfer_quantity\": 15000,\n  \"transfer_cost_total\": 16680.00,\n  \"transfer_cost_per_unit\": 1.112,\n  \"base_B_share\": 0.30,\n  \"B_weekly_demand_base\": 2376,\n  \"days_to_sell_base\": 44.19,\n  \"carrying_cost_total_base\": 16571.70,\n  \"transfer_plus_carry_base\": 33251.70,\n  \"incremental_units_captured_base\": 3800,\n  \"avoided_stockout_benefit_base\": 45600.00,\n  \"net_benefit_base\": 12348.30,\n  \"breakeven_incremental_units\": 2771,\n  \"required_weekly_capture_over_8w\": 346\n}\n\nBottom line: The transfer is economically attractive under plausible market-capture assumptions (Mountain West uplift is real and marketing can capture \u2265~350 incremental units/week). It also settles the operational imperative (freeing A capacity). If you lack confidence in the incremental regional capture, do not move WheyPRO (or move a different higher-velocity SKU), because the carrying costs can overwhelm the transfer benefits.\n\nIf you want, I can: (a) run a sensitivity table across a range of Denver demand share values (e.g., 10%\u201350%) and incremental-capture scenarios; (b) compute alternative moves (move 10k vs 15k) to minimize downside; or (c) draft a short field promotion plan tied to the transfer to maximize capture probability.",
