  "final_answer": "Current Situation:\n- Warehouses & on-hand (from additional notes): Dallas (Warehouse A) = 8,000 units (avg. 12 days remaining shelf life). Denver (Warehouse B) = 3,500 units (avg. 18 days remaining shelf life). Total on-hand = 11,500 units.\n- Product: FB-JUC-ORG-GRN-12Z, shelf life = 45 days, unit cost = $2.15.\n- Demand: Base forecast = 12,000 wk; +5% trend and seasonality factor 1.4 => adjusted weekly demand = 12,000 * 1.05 * 1.4 = 17,640 units/wk -> 2,520 units/day.\n  - Regional split: Texas/South 60% => 10,584/wk (1,512/day). Mountain 40% => 7,056/wk (1,008/day).\n- Supplier disruption: PO#GV-5542 for 20,000 units delayed by 7\u201310 days. Supplier can prioritize and ship a smaller run of 8,000 units in 3 days if we pay a refrigerated dedicated truck premium equal to +15% on standard $0.18/unit freight.\n- Alternatives: Local co-packer (Austin Fresh) can produce up to 10,000 units within 4 days, MOQ 5,000, unit cost $2.50 (delta +$0.35/unit vs supplier). Inter-warehouse refrigerated transfer takes 2 days and costs $0.25/unit.\n- Costs given: carrying cost = $0.01/unit/day; stockout penalty = $1.50/unit.\n- Seasonal context: heatwave_and_drought increases fragility of supply, may increase spoilage risk if temperatures are not tightly controlled.\n\nKey Factors (decision drivers):\n1) Time-to-replenishment vs days-of-supply: current days of supply\n   - Dallas: 8,000 / 1,512 = 5.29 days\n   - Denver: 3,500 / 1,008 = 3.47 days\n   - Combined: 11,500 / 2,520 = 4.56 days\n   Denver will run out first (in ~3.5 days). Combined inventory will be exhausted within ~4.6 days.\n2) Supplier timing uncertainty (7\u201310 days) -> if supplier is at the long end (10 days) we face large shortages and risk losing retail shelf placement if any market is out >5 days.\n3) Cost trade-offs: expedite freight premium (15% of $0.18 freight), higher co-packer unit cost (+$0.35/unit), transfer cost ($0.25/unit), carrying cost ($0.01/unit/day), stockout penalty ($1.50/unit).\n4) Operational constraints: refrigerated transport required, transfer time = 2 days, co-packer production = 4 days (may be regionally close to Texas), supplier expedite = 3 days for a smaller run.\n\nCost Analysis (quantified):\nAssumptions: analyze worst-case supplier arrival at day 10 (10-day delay). Demand from now until day 10 = 2,520 units/day * 10 days = 25,200 units. Current on-hand 11,500 => potential shortage if we do nothing = 25,200 - 11,500 = 13,700 units.\nStockout penalty if we do nothing (worst-case until original PO arrives) = 13,700 * $1.50 = $20,550.\n\nOption 1 \u2014 Expedite partial supplier run (8,000 units in 3 days):\n- Unit purchase cost: 8,000 * $2.15 = $17,200 (this cost would be incurred with any replenishment; incremental here is freight premium and carrying).\n- Expedited freight per unit = $0.18 * (1 + 0.15) = $0.207 -> freight total = 8,000 * $0.207 = $1,656.\n- Extra freight premium (incremental cost vs standard freight) = 8,000 * ($0.207 - $0.18) = 8,000 * $0.027 = $216.\n- Carrying cost for these 8,000 while they sell: at overall sell rate 2,520/day, 8,000 will be consumed in ~3.17 days. Carrying cost \u2248 8,000 * $0.01/day * 3.17 days \u2248 $254.\n- Net incremental cash cost to expedite (premium + incremental carrying) \u2248 $216 + $254 = $470.\n- Impact on stockout (worst-case supplier arrival day 10): with 8,000 arriving at day 3, remaining shortage until day 10 becomes 5,700 units (calculation: demand day0\u20133 consumes 7,560 units leaving 3,940; +8,000 = 11,940 available; demand day3\u201310 = 17,640 -> shortage 17,640 - 11,940 = 5,700). Stockout penalty then = 5,700 * $1.50 = $8,550.\n- Stockout penalty reduction vs do-nothing = $20,550 - $8,550 = $12,000. Net benefit (stockout penalty avoided minus incremental expedite cost) \u2248 $12,000 - $470 = $11,530.\n- Timing/benefit: expedite arrives in 3 days, which covers the imminent Denver shortfall and reduces probability of >5-day outages (insurance against supplier hitting 10-day delay).\n\nOption 2 \u2014 Activate local co-packer (Austin Fresh), minimum 5,000 units in 4 days:\n- Unit cost delta vs supplier: $2.50 - $2.15 = $0.35 extra -> 5,000 * $0.35 = $1,750 incremental production cost.\n- Freight (assume similar refrigerated freight at $0.18/unit unless negotiated) = 5,000 * $0.18 = $900.\n- Carrying cost until sale: 5,000 / 2,520/day \u2248 1.98 days -> carrying \u2248 5,000 * $0.01 * 1.98 \u2248 $99.\n- Total incremental cost (co-packer premium + freight + carrying) \u2248 $1,750 + $900 + $99 \u2248 $2,749.\n- Stockout impact (worst-case): co-packer arrives in 4 days, so after day4 on-hand = 11,500 - (2,520*4 = 10,080) = 1,420 + 5,000 = 6,420. Demand day4\u201310 = 6*2,520 = 15,120 -> shortage = 15,120 - 6,420 = 8,700 units. Stockout penalty = 8,700 * $1.50 = $13,050.\n- Net position: paying ~$2,749 incremental leaves us with a $13,050 stockout risk (cost) -> total expected cost much higher than expedite option.\n- Timing/benefit: production lead = 4 days; Denver is already at high risk earlier (3.5 days). Co-packer alone may be too slow to fully prevent Denver stockouts and is more expensive per unit.\n\nOption 3 \u2014 Rebalance (inter-warehouse transfer):\n- Transfer cost = $0.25/unit, transit time = 2 days.\n- Example: transfer 2,000 units from Dallas to Denver -> cost = 2,000 * $0.25 = $500. Transfer arrival in 2 days would give Denver additional buffer: Denver on-hand before arrival = 3,500 - 1,008*2 = 1,484; +2,000 -> 3,484 then /1,008 = 3.46 days at arrival.\n- Effect: protects Denver from immediate shortfall but depletes Dallas: Dallas becomes 6,000 units (6,000/1,512 = 3.97 days), reducing Dallas buffer. Combined on-hand falls from 11,500 to 9,500 (combined days of supply = 3.77 days). So transfers shift shortfall but do not eliminate the combined shortage unless combined with supplier expedite or co-pack.\n- Transfer is cheap per unit vs co-packer but operationally risky if Dallas is prioritized market.\n\nSpoilage risk and carrying:\n- New supplier or co-packer product will have near-full shelf life (45 days); current stock has 12 and 18 days remaining. Adding replenishment reduces the chance of older inventory spoiling prior to sale because sell-through is accelerated by new volume.\n- Heatwave/drought increases risk\u2014ensure refrigerated transport and strict FIFO. Carrying costs are small relative to stockout penalty ($0.01/unit/day).\n\nTrade-offs (conflicting priorities):\n- Minimize stockout penalty (high $1.50/unit) vs minimize incremental spend on expedited freight or higher co-packer unit costs. Expediting is low incremental spend but consumes limited supplier capacity (8k) and costs some freight premium.\n- Protect high-volume Texas market (60% demand) vs prevent Denver losing placement (Denver runs out sooner). Transfers protect Mountain region but can deplete Texas; supply allocation matters.\n- Speed vs cost: co-packer is slower (4 days) and more expensive per unit; expedite is faster (3 days) and far cheaper incremental cost.\n\nRecommendation (clear action, with numbers):\nPrimary recommended course (highest expected economic value with lowest operational risk):\n1) Immediately instruct Golden Valley Organics to prioritize the 8,000-unit expedited run and pay the dedicated refrigerated truck premium. Rationale:\n   - Incremental cost (premium + carrying) \u2248 $470.\n   - Reduces worst-case stockout penalty from $20,550 to $8,550 (benefit ~$12,000). Net expected benefit \u2248 $11,530.\n   - Expedite arrives in 3 days, addressing Denver's immediate shortfall risk and materially reducing probability of any >5-day out-of-stock event.\n2) Allocation recommendation for the 8,000 expedited units: split in proportion to demand but bias slightly toward Denver because it is closest to stockout. Suggested split: Denver 3,500\u20134,000 units, Dallas 4,000\u20134,500 units. Practical preferred split: Denver = 4,000; Dallas = 4,000 (even split) or Denver 4,500 / Dallas 3,500 if field intelligence indicates Denver accounts for at-risk shelf placement. (If stores at Denver region have high-value shelf placements, prioritize Denver up to 4,500 units.)\n   - Example with 60/40 proportional split of 8,000 => Dallas 4,800 / Denver 3,200. This is workable; however giving Denver at least 4,000 is prudent given its lower days-of-supply.\n3) Concurrent contingency: instruct logistics team to prepare an inter-warehouse transfer of up to 2,000 units from Dallas to Denver (cost $500) to be executed only if supplier fails to confirm expedite within 24 hours or if real-time daily sales exceed model (given the Healthy Living campaign-driven surge). Transfer takes 2 days and will shore up Denver prior to the expedite if necessary. Note: this transfer reduces Dallas buffer; therefore only execute if daily POS data shows Denver depleting faster than forecast.\n4) Place a standing option with Austin Fresh (co-packer) to produce 5,000 units (MOQ) on 24\u201336 hour notice (production lead = 4 days). Approve as secondary contingency if supplier communication by Day 3\u20134 indicates the main PO will be delayed beyond 10 days. If exercised, expect incremental cost \u2248 $2,750 for 5,000 units (premium + freight + carrying) but it prevents long-duration outages beyond day 4\u20137 if supplier fails.\n5) Operational safeguards: require refrigerated, real-time temperature-tracked transport for all expedited/co-packed shipments; apply strict FIFO (push older inventory to highest-velocity stores first) to limit spoilage given heatwave context.\n\nQuantified example of recommended immediate actions and net expected impact (worst-case supplier arrival day 10):\n- Pay expedite for 8,000 units -> incremental outlay \u2248 $216 (freight premium) + ~$254 (extra carrying) = ~$470.\n- Execute allocation: 4,000 to Denver, 4,000 to Dallas (arrive day 3). After arrival, remaining shortage until day 10 = 5,700 units -> stockout penalty $8,550. Net stockout penalty avoided \u2248 $12,000.\n- If supplier confirms arrival earlier (day 7), expedite likely eliminates shortage entirely.\n- Contingency transfer (only if needed): move up to 2,000 units from Dallas to Denver at $0.25/unit = $500.\n\nRisks & key uncertainties:\n1) Supplier reliability: Golden Valley\u2019s reliability score is 0.78; if they cannot deliver the expedited 8k or the original PO slips beyond 10 days, we may still face shortages -> contingency co-packer activation will be required.\n2) Demand upside (Healthy Living campaign + seasonality): If actual daily demand outpaces our adjusted forecast (2,520/day), on-hand will deplete faster than modeled; monitor daily POS and be ready to execute transfer / co-packer option.\n3) Spoilage risk due to heatwave: elevated temperature risk increases spoilage probability; ensure refrigerated chain and consider slightly faster rotation of older stock to highest-velocity outlets.\n4) Allocation mistakes: moving inventory from Dallas to Denver or allocating expedited supply incorrectly could cause a secondary shortage in the higher-volume Texas market \u2014 use real-time sales to refine allocation during the 72-hour window.\n5) Freight & operational constraints: refrigerated truck availability might be limited; confirm carrier availability immediately to lock the 3-day expedited slot.\n\nWhat I did and produced:\n- Analyzed current inventory, demand, supplier delays, and operational constraints using the provided data (on-hand units, shelf life, demand, supplier delay, transport and carrying costs).\n- Quantified days-of-supply by location and combined, computed shortage if no action under a 10-day supplier delay (13,700 units shortage; $20,550 stockout penalty).\n- Calculated incremental costs and stockout impacts for three options: expedited partial supplier run (8,000 units in 3 days), co-packer (5,000 min in 4 days), and inter-warehouse transfers (2-day transit at $0.25/unit).\n- Recommended a prioritized, quantified plan: expedite 8,000 units now (incremental \u2248 $470) with allocation biased to Denver, hold a 2,000-unit transfer as conditional contingency (cost $500 if executed), and keep the co-packer on standby (5,000 MOQ) if supplier slips beyond day 4\u20135.\n\nBottom line (concise): Pay to expedite 8,000 units now. This costs a small incremental amount (~$470) but reduces expected stockout penalty by roughly $12,000 under the worst-case scenario and materially lowers the risk of losing retail shelf placement. Prepare a small conditional transfer (\u22642,000 units) and keep the co-packer as a fallback if the supplier cannot meet even the expedited commitment.",
