Promo (Midwest) starts in 5 days (2025-10-20) and runs 10 days.\\n- On-hand inventory: Riverside = 3,600 units (capacity 5,000, 72% util.); Columbus = 2,470 units (capacity 3,800, 65% util.). eCommerce reserves: Riverside 300, Columbus 150 (not reassigneable). Riverside quality hold 120 units releases in 24h.\\n- Open PO GG-11753 = 8,500 units. Standard ETA = 10 days (2025-10-25). Expedite option can move at least 3,000 units to a 7-day ETA (2025-10-22); remaining 5,500 would remain on standard timing if minimum expedite split used. Supplier MRSL = 11 days remaining life on arrival for both modes.\\n- Product: PF-OG-SALADKIT-10OZ, shelf life = 14 days, unit cost = $2.35.\\n- Demand: base weekly forecast 8,400 units; actual trend +28% and seasonality factor 1.27 \u2192 adjusted weekly demand = 8,400 * 1.28 * 1.27 = 13,648 units/week \u2192 daily network demand \u2248 1,949.7 units/day. Demand mix: Midwest 60% (\u22481,169.8 units/day), West 40% (\u2248779.9 units/day).\\n- On-hand remaining life (at timestamp): Riverside: 900 units (4d), 1,700 (7d), 1,000 (10d). Columbus: 650 (3d), 1,100 (5d), 720 (9d).\\n- Store acceptance rule: promo stores must receive product with \u22655 days remaining at DC ship time. Non-promo stores accept \u22653 days.\\n- Transfers: Riverside \u2192 Columbus takes 2 days transit, cost ~$0.16/unit, expected shrink 1.2% (units lost), transfer units lose 2 days of shelf life in transit.\\n- Cost inputs: transport premium 19% on expedited quantity; standard refrigerated linehaul $0.85/unit; carrying cost $0.022/unit/day; stockout penalty $3.20/unit. Expedited receiving overtime = $1,200 per load if required.\\n\\nImmediate operational constraint: Promo starts in 5 days. For a product to be eligible for promo shipments on day 5 (promo start), the current remaining life must be \u2265 10 days (because current_remaining - 5days >= 5days). Using that test:\\n- Riverside has 1,000 units with 10 days remaining \u2192 these are the only currently on-hand units that will meet the promo \u22655d requirement on promo day1. Columbus has 0 units with current_remaining \u226510 \u2192 Columbus has no eligible units for the promo start.\\n\\nImplication: Without earlier inbound inventory, Columbus cannot satisfy promo shipments on day1 except by receiving eligible transfers from Riverside (the 1,000 units) or by receiving an earlier PO arrival (expedited) \u2014 note expedited earliest arrival is day7 (Oct22) which is 2 days into promo, so it will not cover promo day1\u20132.\\n\\nKey Factors (decision drivers)\\n1) Timing: Promo starts in 5 days; standard PO arrives in 10 days (promo day6), expedited earliest is 7 days (promo day3). First 2 promo days (day1\u20132) cannot be helped by expedited PO (arrives day3). Only transfers from Riverside can supply promo day1\u20132.\\n2) On-hand age constraints: To be eligible for promo shipments at day t, current_remaining >= (t + 5). Only 1,000 Riverside units meet requirement for early promo shipments.\\n3) PO size and split: PO total 8,500; expediting a minimum 3,000 shifts timing of 3,000 units to day3 but does not increase total network supply during promo window beyond what is usable given shelf-life rules.\\n4) Costs: expedited transport premium = 19% of $0.85 = $0.1615/unit extra; overtime receiving $1,200/load; transfer cost $0.16/unit + expected shrink 1.2%.\\n5) Service targets and penalties: promo fill target 97% (retailer penalty if fill rate <90%: $500/DC/day). Stockout penalty per unit = $3.20.\\n6) Capacity: both DCs can receive up to 2 inbound POs/day; expedited receiving overtime requires pre-approval and ~$1,200 per load.\\n\\nCost Analysis (quantified)\\nAssumptions used / short summary of calculations:\\n- Daily Midwest demand = 1,169.8 units/day. Total promo demand (10 days) = 11,698 units.\\n- Only units that currently have \u226510 days remaining are eligible to be shipped to promo stores on promo day1 (Oct20). That is Riverside 1,000 units.\\n- PO total 8,500 units arrives either (A) 10 days (standard) or (B) split: at least 3,000 at 7 days + remainder 5,500 at 10 days if we choose minimal expedite.\\n- Transfer of 1,000 units from Riverside \u2192 Columbus: cost 1,000 * $0.16 = $160; expected shrink (1.2%) = 12 units lost \u2192 lost unit cost 12 * $2.35 = $28.20 (we treat shrink as incremental waste cost). The transfer is needed regardless of expedite choice to cover promo start.\\n\\nScenario-level supply math (usable for promo):\\n- Existing usable on-hand for promo start in Columbus = 0.\\n- Transferable eligible units from Riverside for promo = 1,000 units (if moved immediately).\\n- PO usable for promo depends on arrival date: Standard arrival on promo day6 (Oct25) supplies 8,500 units from day6 onward. Expedite of 3,000 arrives on promo day3 (Oct22), leaving 5,500 arriving day6.\\n- Because of shelf-life constraints, other on-hand lots (Riverside 1,700@7d; Columbus 720@9d etc.) cannot be used for promo shipments at the relevant early dates.\\n\\nNet usable supply over the promo (typical feasible allocation):\\n- Transfer 1,000 (immediate)\\n- PO total usable during promo = 8,500 (either all on day6 if standard, or split 3,000 day3 + 5,500 day6 if expedite-minimum)\\n=> Total usable for Midwest promo = 9,500 units.\\n- Demand over promo = 11,698 units \u2192 cumulative shortfall = 11,698 - 9,500 = 2,198 units.\\n\\nCosts of actions and shortfalls\\nA) Cost to expedite minimum 3,000 units (incremental):\\n- Transport premium: 3,000 * ($0.85 * 19%) = 3,000 * $0.1615 = $484.50\\n- Likely expedited receiving overtime (one load): $1,200 (pre-approve) \u2192 assume applied = $1,200\\n- Transfer cost (1,000 units from Riverside): $160\\n- Transfer shrink: 12 units \u2192 cost 12*$2.35 = $28.20\\nTotal incremental cash outlay (expedite3k + transfer) \u2248 $484.50 + $1,200 + $160 + $28.20 = $1,872.70\\n\\nB) Stockout costs if we do not change supply (or even if we expedite min 3k):\\n- Total unmet units across the promo (in either case) = 2,198 units \u2192 stockout penalty = 2,198 * $3.20 = $7,033.60\\n- Retailer penalty risk: if fill rate <90% for the Midwest retailer, penalty $500/DC/day applies. Under baseline (no expedite) shortage is concentrated in first 5 promo days (days 1\u20135) producing multiple days with fill <90% \u2192 conservatively 5 days penalty = $2,500. If we expedite 3k, the shortage shifts later and may reduce the number of days under 90% by ~1 day; conservatively expedite might reduce this penalty by ~$500. Exact days depend on allocation; we use conservative estimate of $500 difference.\\n\\nNet economic delta for minimal expedite (3,000) vs no expedite\\n- Incremental explicit logistical cost to expedite (including transfer): \u2248 $1,872.70\\n- Reduction in retailer penalties / immediate stockout pain: estimated ~$500 reduction in retailer penalty (best realistic) and negligible reduction in total stockout units (the cumulative shortfall remains 2,198 units). Therefore net incremental cost \u2248 $1,872.70 - $500 \u2248 $1,372.70 (still a net cost), while cumulative stockouts remain ~2,198 units (stockout cost $7,034) under both options.\\n\\nNotes on carrying costs and spoilage:\\n- Carrying cost per unit-day = $0.022. Expediting causes the expedited units to arrive earlier (fewer days in transit but more days in DC/use) \u2014 net carrying impact small relative to transport premium; ignored for first-order decision (we can quantify: 3,000 units * 3 days earlier * $0.022/day \u2248 $198 saved carrying? Actually earlier arrival increases days on-hand until sale \u2014 but net network carrying effect depends on when those units are sold; effect small vs transport premium). The dominant costs are transport premium vs stockout penalties.\\n\\nTrade-offs (conflicting priorities)\\n- Expedite reduces early-in-promo shortfalls (improves daily fill for days 3\u20135) but does NOT change cumulative available usable inventory for the whole promo window under the current PO size and shelf-life constraints. Therefore expediting 3,000 mainly shifts shortages in time rather than eliminating them.\\n- Expedite incremental transport/overtime costs (~$1.7k) vs limited avoided retailer penalties (~$0.5k) and no reduction in total lost-sales stockout units (no change in aggregate stockout cost $7.0k). Net financial outcome is a small increase in cost if we choose minimal expedite.\\n- The only way to materially reduce aggregate stockouts is to increase usable supply during promo (i.e., obtain additional units that are acceptable to ship to promo stores during the promo window). Under current shelf-life constraints and current on-hand age, the PO quantity (8,500) + eligible on-hand (1,000) = 9,500 max usable for the promo, so additional supply beyond the PO would be required to eliminate the shortfall (e.g., buy extra from supplier or third-party local buy or re-purpose eCommerce reserves if allowable).\\n\\nRecommendation (clear action & quantified cost/benefit)\\nPrimary recommendation (cost-optimal given provided data):\\n1) Do NOT expedite the PO GG-11753 solely to reduce supplier lead time from 10 \u2192 7 days using the minimum 3,000 expedite option. Reason: incremental transport + receiving cost (~$1,872.70) yields only limited reduction in early-day retailer penalties (~$500) and does NOT reduce the cumulative stockout units (2,198 units) during the 10-day promo. Net incremental cost is ~ $1.37k (worse off) while aggregate stockout loss remains ~$7.03k. In other words: expedite-min 3k is not cost-effective with the current PO size and on-hand age profile.\\n\\n2) Immediate operational actions to mitigate the worst impacts (mandatory regardless of expedite decision):\\n- Immediately transfer the 1,000 Riverside units with 10 days remaining to Columbus (arrive in ~2 days). Cost: $160 transport + expected shrink ~$28.20. This is required to enable any promo shipments on promo day1 and day2 and is low-cost relative to the penalty of doing nothing. (Net incremental cost \u2248 $188.)\\n- Release the 120-unit quality hold at Riverside as soon as certified (available in 24 hours). If those units have sufficient remaining life they should be earmarked for promotional use if eligible. (Small incremental benefit.)\\n- Re-review eCommerce holds: request permission (if contractually feasible) to reallocate any of the eCommerce reserved units (300 Riverside, 150 Columbus) to the promo to reduce stockouts \u2014 quantify revenue/share impact vs lost eCommerce sales. If even a portion of these can be reallocated it reduces the 2,198 unit shortfall materially.\\n- Negotiate with supplier (GreenGrove) immediately for either (a) an additional emergency short PO to supply Midwest (quantity ~2,500 units needed to eliminate the shortfall), or (b) increase expedite quantity above 3,000 if allowed \u2014 but note even full expedite of the existing PO to day3 does not eliminate aggregate shortfall; so additional units beyond the 8,500 are required to meet promo demand.\\n- Prepare contingency with retail customer: communicate likely constrained days (promo day1\u20132) and attempt to renegotiate promo fulfillment SLAs or request temporary flexibility (avoid retailer penalty if possible). If retailer penalty cannot be waived, focus on minimizing days <90% fill to reduce $500/day penalties.\\n\\nIf management still wants to expedite some of the PO for service reasons (non-financial or political reasons), use this controlled option:\\n- If you must expedite: expedite only what supplier can guarantee and route expedited quantity to Columbus; expedite charging and overtime ~$1,872.70 for 3,000 yields minimal improvement. If the goal is to materially reduce cumulative stockouts, instead request an additional emergency shipment (purchase + expedite) of ~2,200\u20132,500 units allocated to Columbus. Economics: additional 2,198 units to fully avoid the 2,198 unit shortfall would cost (at minimum) incremental transport premium + linehaul + purchase cost (unit_cost = $2.35) and will avoid stockout penalty ~$7,034 + potential retailer penalties ~$2,500. Rough incremental: if we could buy additional 2,200 units from supplier and expedite them: transport premium = 2,200*$0.1615 = $355; overtime ~$1,200; purchase cost 2,200*$2.35 = $5,170; transferring if needed small. Total incremental ~ $6,725. Avoided stockout cost ~$7,034 + avoided retailer penalty ~$2,500 => net beneficial if retailer penalty and lost sales are unavoidable. So the right economic move to eliminate the shortfall would be to procure an emergency incremental quantity of ~2,200 units and expedite them (cost roughly in the $6.7k range) \u2014 that is financially sensible compared to the stockout+penalty ~$9.5k cost. (Recommendation: pursue this if supplier can support emergency additional quantity.)\\n\\nSummary numeric highlights (rounded):\\n- Promo demand (Midwest, 10d): 11,698 units.\\n- Usable supply (transfer 1,000 + PO 8,500): 9,500 units \u2192 shortfall 2,198 units \u2192 stockout penalty \u2248 $7,034.\\n- Cost to expedite minimum 3,000 units: incremental ~$1,873 (transport premium + overtime + transfer) and yields little reduction in cumulative stockouts; net is a cost increase (~$1.37k) vs no-expedite.\\n- Cost to fully eliminate shortfall: estimated additional emergency purchase & expedite of ~2,200 units would cost ~ $6.7k but would avoid ~$9.5k (stockout+retailer penalty) \u2192 worthwhile if supplier can supply.\\n\\nOperational actionable checklist (ordered):\\n1) Immediately initiate transfer of 1,000 Riverside units to Columbus (cost \u2248 $160 + shrink \u2248 $28). Do this now (must be in transit to arrive before promo).\\n2) Release the 120 units on quality hold ASAP and re-evaluate their remaining life; earmark if eligible.\\n3) Do NOT expend the minimal expedite (3,000) as a first choice \u2014 it is not cost-effective alone. Instead, use negotiations with the supplier to: (a) request an emergency supplemental PO of ~2,200 units shipped expedited to Columbus, OR (b) if supplier cannot supply extra units, consider increasing the expedite split but recognize that even full expedite of the 8,500 PO does not remove the shortfall.\\n4) Communicate proactively to the Midwest retailer(s) about fill risk and attempt to negotiate temporary acceptance rules or penalty relief; quantify expected daily fill rates and penalty exposure.\\n5) Post-promo, analyze FEFO aging decisions and reorder cadence to avoid similar shelf-life / promo timing mismatches for perishable SKUs. Consider holding a small surge safety stock for promo windows.\\n\\nRisks / Key uncertainties\\n- Supplier early/late variability: supplier has had +/-1 day variability in past deliveries (2 of last 10). This could move a standard arrival earlier by 1 day, but not reliably. Reliance on luck is risky.\\n- Winter weather risk increases next week; could worsen transport times if deliveries are delayed beyond quoted ETAs.\\n- The estimate of demand per day uses adjusted forecast (trend + seasonality). If actual promo uplift in Midwest exceeds this (retailer promo could spike local demand beyond our demand mix assumption), shortfall could be larger.\\n- Retailer acceptance rules are firm on MRSL. If retailer negotiates exception to \u22655d rule, more on-hand units at Columbus/Riverside could be used. This is a negotiation lever.\\n- eCommerce reserve reallocation depends on contractual constraints; we treated them as not reassignable unless explicitly negotiated.\\n\\nWhat I did and produced\\n- I analyzed your inventory snapshot, PO timing, on-hand FEFO ages, and promo timing.\\n- I computed adjusted demand (8,400 weekly \u2192 13,648 weekly after trend & seasonality; Midwest daily demand \u2248 1,169.8), and mapped usable inventory per store based on remaining life and store acceptance rules.\\n- I quantified shipment/transfer costs, expected shrink, transport premium for expedited shipments, and stockout penalties.\\n- I compared the economic outcome of expediting the minimum (3,000) versus not expediting and the economic case for purchasing additional emergency quantity to eliminate the shortfall.\\n- I produced clear, prioritized recommendations with numeric cost/benefit calculations and an operational action checklist.\\n\\nBottom line recommendation (one-line): Do not spend to expedite the minimum 3,000 units \u2014 instead immediately transfer the 1,000 eligible Riverside units to Columbus, push the supplier for an emergency supplemental shipment of ~2,200 units (expedited to Columbus) if possible, and negotiate with the retailer to limit penalties; only expedite additional quantity if it meaningfully increases usable supply above the 8,500 PO (i.e., if supplier can provide extra units).\",\n      \"artifacts\": null\n    }\n  }\n}",
