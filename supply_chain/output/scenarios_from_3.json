A 'Healthy Habits' marketing campaign starts next Monday (in 6 days). \n- On-hand age (FEFO): \n  - Chicago (1,800 units): 800 units have 2 days remaining; 1,000 units have 4 days remaining. \n  - Denver (1,150 units): 550 units have 3 days remaining; 600 units have 5 days remaining. \n- Store acceptance rule: Retailers require a minimum of 4 days shelf life remaining upon DC departure. Anything less is rejected. \n- Open PO: CPJ-8832 for 4,500 units. Standard arrival ETA: 2025-08-17 (5 days). Expedite option (air freight) reduces arrival to 2025-08-15 (3 days). Supplier can expedite in minimums of 1,000 units. MRSL on arrival is 8 days. \n- Logistics costs: standard refrigerated transport ~ $0.90/unit. Expedite air freight adds 25% to this cost. \n- DC-to-DC transfer (Chicago \u2192 Denver): 2 days transit. This is considered extremely risky for this product, as it would arrive with only 1-2 days of usable life after accounting for picking/packing time. Not a recommended option. \n- Capacity: Chilled capacity is not a concern at either DC. \n- Service target: Maintain a 96% fill rate to avoid losing premium shelf placement to a competitor who is launching a similar product. \n- Reserved/constraints: Online subscription orders have reserved 200 units in Chicago and 100 in Denver for shipment in the next 48 hours. \n- Expiry/markdown: Product is a total loss upon expiry (cost $3.75 + $0.05 disposal). There is no secondary market or markdown opportunity. \n- Risk: The supplier's production process is sensitive; they have had to cut orders by 10-15% with 24-hour notice twice in the last year due to ingredient quality issues. The 45% demand trend is based on only two weeks of data and may not be stable."

NX-TAB10 current on-hand by site: A = 20,160 units (336 pallets; 60 units/pallet), B = 12,480 units (208 pallets). Pipeline: PO BT-7841 (12,000 units) currently routed to A, ETA 2025-10-17 (2 days); diverting to B adds 2 days transit and applies a +16.8% transport premium to the base inter-DC cost. Additional POs: BT-7890 (8,000 units to A, ETA 2025-10-24) and BT-7922 (6,000 units to B, ETA 2025-10-27). Regional demand split: West 45%, East 55% of network forecast; recent actuals trending -18% vs forecast network-wide, with West underperforming more than East. \n\nSpace outlook at A: Total pallet slots (60 units/slot) = 2,000; currently used ~1,440; immediately available ~560. Time-phased inbound at A for other SKUs within 5 days: PF-SALAD-12 (perishable_food, 7-day shelf life) 40,800 units (~680 pallets) supporting a retailer health-push promo; if not stored at A, must go to nearby overflow 3PL with 8\u201310% expected shrink. Optional PF-JUICE-18 (14-day shelf life) 7,200 units (~120 pallets) may stage if space allows. If NX-TAB10 PO BT-7841 is received at A as planned (12,000 units = ~200 pallets), available slots would fall from ~560 to ~360 just as PF-SALAD-12 arrives, creating an estimated shortfall of ~320 pallets vs. the 680-pallet requirement. \n\nWarehouse B constraints: Temporary racking repair reduces available capacity by ~10% to 90,000 units through 2025-10-25 (reflected in current capacity). Current headroom at B = 13,500 units (~225 pallets). Accepting the 12,000-unit diversion would raise B utilization to ~98% until picks and the 10/25 capacity restoration relieve pressure. \n\nCost context to evaluate: Base inter-DC linehaul (A to B) averages $1.60 per unit; premium transport adds +16.8% when used. Local overflow 3PL near A: $18 per pallet/week storage, $12 per pallet inbound handling, $12 per pallet outbound handling; 50-pallet weekly minimum; typical accessorials apply. Port demurrage for delaying drayage (if considered as an alternative) averages ~$165 per container/day after last free day (3 containers for the 12,000 units). NX-TAB10 gross margin guidance (for mix considerations): ~$32 per unit; perishable PF-SALAD-12 estimated margin ~$6 per unit but with high shrink risk beyond 7 days. Service levels: eCommerce 97% fill target, retail 95% fill target; typical lead-times: A serves West in 1\u20132 days, B serves East in 1\u20132 days. Labor: A is already running two overtime shifts on receiving this week; B is constrained on putaway until racking work completes. No additional dock doors available at A during 10/16\u201310/18 peak inbound window."

The inbound vitamin shipment (4,000 units, ~40 pallets) is scheduled to use that exact staging area. If it is not diverted, the allergy spray will not have a designated staging zone for temperature validation and QC checks upon arrival, violating GMP protocol and risking the entire shipment's integrity (value ~$750k). The only certified cold-chain 3PL nearby is fully booked.\n\nWarehouse B constraints: The Denver facility is undergoing a scheduled validation of its cold chain monitoring system, which does not affect ambient products like the vitamins. However, overall receiving capacity is reduced by 30% as technicians are occupying dock space and staff are involved in the validation process.

An inbound shipment of IND-BRG-5512 (PO PP-6554, 30,000 units) is due in 2 days. The decision is whether to divert it to Dallas. Diversion adds 2 days transit and a 15.1% transport premium. Regional demand split: Midwest 65%, South 35%.\n\nSpace outlook at A: A just-in-time shipment of IND-HYD-PUMP-V8 (80 large hydraulic pumps) for a key automotive client is arriving in 3 days. These pumps are oversized, non-stackable, and require a specific 5,000 sq ft staging area with access for a heavy-duty forklift. The inbound bearing shipment (30,000 units, ~50 standard pallets) is routed to the only available receiving area, which doubles as the only feasible staging zone for the pumps. If the bearings arrive as planned, the pumps cannot be unloaded safely or efficiently, causing a 2-3 day delay. The client's assembly line would be shut down, incurring a contract penalty of $100,000 per day. Using an external heavy-lift 3PL is an option, but would cost a flat $25,000 and add 24 hours of handling time.\n\nWarehouse B constraints: The Dallas facility is experiencing severe outbound congestion due to a surge in orders from the energy sector. All 20 of its outbound dock doors are fully scheduled for the next 4 days, and the yard is at 95% trailer capacity. An unscheduled inbound shipment would have to be 'live unloaded' in the yard, a slow process that is 50% less efficient and carries a higher risk of product damage. This would likely delay the receipt processing by 48-72 hours. Base inter-DC transport cost is $1.25 per unit."

An inbound shipment of CPG-SNCK-CHIP-BBQ (PO TM-2189, 18,000 cases) is due in 3 days. The decision is whether to divert it to Kansas City. Diversion adds 3 days transit and a 17.5% transport premium. Regional demand split: Southeast 50%, Central 50%.\n\nOperational outlook at A: A massive, pre-built promotional shipment of BEV-SODA-PROMO-24PK (200,000 cases of soda) is arriving in 4 days for a major summer ad campaign. These are pre-built pallet displays that are extremely heavy and can only be handled by the facility's automated conveyor system for direct putaway into a specific high-density storage zone. The inbound chip shipment (18,000 cases, ~300 pallets) is light but bulky and requires manual forklift handling. The receiving docks equipped for manual unloading are the same ones that feed the automated conveyor. If the chip shipment is being unloaded, the conveyor system cannot be used for the soda, and vice-versa. Unloading the chips will take a full 8-hour shift, which falls directly in the arrival window for the soda. Delaying the soda receipt will cause a missed promotional launch date, with an estimated $80,000 penalty in co-op advertising funds from the retail partner.\n\nWarehouse B constraints: The Kansas City facility's primary AS/RS (Automated Storage and Retrieval System) is down for unscheduled emergency maintenance for the next 3-5 days. All putaway and retrieval is being done manually, which is 3x slower and has created a 36-hour inbound processing backlog. Diverting the chip shipment would push B's utilization to ~92% and add to the existing backlog, increasing the risk of damage from staging on the dock for an extended period. Base inter-DC transport cost is $1.40 per case."
