# Learning Evaluation Foundation – Research Log

## 2025-10-29

- 10:00 EDT — Reviewed `docs/runtime_eval.md` to refresh the dual-agent evaluation harness goals, dataset structure, and learning registry integration. Key reminders: learning state is injected via `learning` config block; evaluation emits reward/latency metrics and expects pamphlet guidance hooks.
- 10:07 EDT — Studied `docs/learning_eval.md` (pre-rename) to capture current terminology (“policy nuggets”) and telemetry workflow. Noted existing rubric gates (actionability, cue presence, generality), usage tracking toggles, and report outputs (usage metrics, efficiency snapshot) that will need renaming and augmentation.
- 10:18 EDT — Read `Continual Learning Online Adaptation.tex` to align on definitions: adaptive efficiency = higher success with lower token cost over time; cross-incident transfer = guidance reused on new incidents; differentiation vs. reinforcement tied to failure avoidance vs. reuse. Memo also highlights reward/token trajectories and incident IDs as essential signals.
- 10:42 EDT — Parsed Issue #82 (“Evaluate Learning Synthesizer Quality & Meta-Prompt Redesign”). Success criteria: enforce schema/rubric with provenance, instrument runtime for cue/adoption telemetry, document evaluation workflow, and prepare research plan for prompt/model benchmarking. Dependencies: relies on runtime instrumentation (usage metrics) and report surfacing—shared with #91.
- 10:48 EDT — Parsed Issue #87 (“Rename policy nuggets to learning playbook entries”). Success criteria: rename modules/APIs to “playbook entries”, update metadata keys with backwards compatibility, refresh evaluation outputs/tests/docs, and verify reports + smoke tests. Depends on baseline artifacts pre-rename and on usage metrics introduced for #82/#91.
- 10:53 EDT — Parsed Issue #91 (“Add impact metrics for learning playbook evaluation”). Success criteria: capture reward/token deltas, incident IDs, transfer/failure signals per playbook entry; aggregate adoption/impact metrics in reports; extend tests/docs accordingly. Builds on instrumentation from #82 and must land after/beside the rename in #87 so terminology matches.
- 11:12 EDT — Ran `pytest` (108 passed, 161.41s) to establish a clean baseline prior to renames/metric work; no failures observed.
- 11:20 EDT — Inspected `results/learning/20251028T1600Z_gemini_flash_v0` baseline artifacts; confirmed current report keys use `policy_metrics`/`lifecycle_summary` with null payloads, establishing reference to update during rename.
- 11:31 EDT — Renamed `atlas/learning/nuggets.py` → `atlas/learning/playbook_entries.py`, updated synthesizer/imports/tests/configs to emit/store `playbook_entries`, and refreshed docs (`docs/learning_eval.md`, configs) plus evaluation outputs (`playbook_metrics`, `playbook_lifecycle_summary`).

- 11:38 EDT — Completed rename sweep: updated prompts/config/docs/tests to use playbook entry terminology and reran unit suite (`pytest` 108 passed, 157.35s) confirming clean break from legacy naming.
- 11:45 EDT — Removed legacy `policy_*` fallbacks across synthesizer, evaluation, usage tracker, and CLI flags to keep the playbook entry rename minimal; updated docs/tests accordingly prior to proceeding to impact metrics.
