Task ID: 83d10b06-26d1-4636-a32c-23f92c57f30b

Primary source
- Population.xlsx: Stated in the task as the attached spreadsheet containing Anti-Financial Crime Risk Metrics for Q2 and Q3 2024. All testing steps and formulas were designed to operate directly on Population.xlsx. Due to tool-access constraints in this interface, the file could not be opened to extract headers, counts, or data rows.

Summary by objective with evidence and gaps

1) Sample size calculation (90% CL, 10% tolerable error)
- Evidence and method prepared:
  - Attribute sampling basis and formula set up for Population.xlsx:
    - n0 = ((Z^2) * p * (1 − p)) / e^2 with Z=1.645, e=0.10, p=0.50 (conservative), yielding n0 = 67.650625
    - Finite population correction (FPC), by Population.xlsx population size N: n = n0 / (1 + (n0 − 1)/N)
    - Final sample = ROUNDUP(n,0), capped at N
  - The above is designed to be documented in a “Sample Size Calculation” tab (to be included in the Sample workbook).
- Gaps/uncertainties:
  - N (eligible population size) could not be derived from Population.xlsx in this interface, so the final integer sample size remains pending. The result is expressible as n = 67.650625 / (1 + 66.650625/N) until N is taken from Population.xlsx.

2) Quarter-on-quarter variance analysis (Population.xlsx columns H=Q2, I=Q3; J = variance)
- Evidence and method prepared:
  - Implementable formula for J in Population.xlsx: =IF(AND(H2=0,I2=0),0,IF(H2=0,""N/A"",(I2-H2)/H2))
  - Implementable flag for “exceptionally large change” (division-by-zero case) in Population.xlsx: in a helper column (e.g., K): =AND(H2=0,I2<>0)
  - Formatting guidance for J as Percentage to ensure interpretability.
- Gaps/uncertainties:
  - Column headers and positions (H for Q2; I for Q3) were not verified inside Population.xlsx due to no file access. The formulas are prepared but not yet written into Population.xlsx nor validated against actual data types/values.

3) Sample selection aligned to criteria
- Evidence and method prepared (to be executed on Population.xlsx):
  - Criteria-based helper columns designed to ensure each criterion is captured at least once across the selected sample:
    - Absolute variance >20% (using ABS(J) > 0.2); prioritization by absolute change
    - Named entities: CB Cash Italy; CB Correspondent Banking Greece; IB Debt Markets Luxembourg; CB Trade Finance Brazil; PB EMEA UAE
    - High-risk metrics: A1 and C1
    - Both-zero rows (Q2=0 and Q3=0)
    - Business lines: Trade Finance and Correspondent Banking
    - Countries: Cayman Islands, Pakistan, UAE (or United Arab Emirates)
    - Coverage across all Divisions and Sub-Divisions present in Population.xlsx
  - Structured selection order for Population.xlsx:
    1) Include all mandatory items (A1/C1, named entities, both-zero, specified business lines and countries)
    2) Ensure Division/Sub-Division coverage
    3) Fill remaining slots with >20% variance, highest absolute change first
    4) If mandatory items exceed required sample size, include all mandatory and document override
- Gaps/uncertainties:
  - No concrete rows could be listed or marked in Population.xlsx without file access. Field names/positions for Metric, Entity, Business Line, Division, Sub-Division, Country in Population.xlsx are unconfirmed.

4) Creation of ‘Sample’ workbook (deliverable)
- Evidence and method prepared:
  - Tab 1 “Sample”: Copy exact rows from Population.xlsx where Selected=1 (column K), preserving original column order and ensuring K=1 on each sampled row; include a COUNTIF($K:$K,1) cross-check to match Tab 2’s final sample size.
  - Tab 2 “Sample Size Calculation”: Show parameters (Z=1.645; e=0.10; p=0.50), formulas (n0, FPC), N (sourced from Population.xlsx), final sample size; include notes on assumptions and any document gaps.
  - Both tabs to explicitly cite Population.xlsx as the data source.
- Gaps/uncertainties:
  - Neither N nor selected rows (K=1) could be extracted from Population.xlsx; hence the final workbook content could not be pasted in this interface.

Assumptions and unresolved dependencies
- Population size (N): Must be computed from Population.xlsx (e.g., count of eligible unique records). Without N, the final sample size cannot be finalized.
- Data structure in Population.xlsx: Positions/headers for Q2 (H) and Q3 (I), and the presence/names of columns for Metric, Entity, Business Line, Division, Sub-Division, and Country remain unverified.
- Internal methodology/documents: No separate Internal Audit Sampling Methodology or metric dictionary was accessible in this interface. The conservative default p=0.50 was used pending any alternative specified methodology. If such a document exists among cached references, it was not accessible here to confirm.

What is ready to execute once Population.xlsx is accessible
- Write formulas to Population.xlsx:
  - J (variance): =IF(AND(H2=0,I2=0),0,IF(H2=0,""N/A"",(I2-H2)/H2))
  - Helper flags for each sampling criterion (absolute variance; named entities; A1/C1; both-zero; business lines; countries); priority score logic that emphasizes >20% variance first
- Compute:
  - N from Population.xlsx and finalize sample size via FPC
  - Candidate pool filtered to AnyCriteria_Flag=1; sorted by PriorityScore and absolute change
  - Final selected set to meet all mandatory coverage; then fill remaining slots by variance
- Produce:
  - Sample.xlsx with:
    - Tab 1 “Sample”: all selected rows from Population.xlsx (K=1)
    - Tab 2 “Sample Size Calculation”: full workings, assumptions, and cross-check that COUNTIF($K:$K,1) equals final sample size

Requests to complete the audit evidence pack
- From Population.xlsx:
  - Header row and exact column letters for: Metric (to find A1/C1), Entity, Business Line, Division, Sub-Division, Country, and Q2/Q3 locations
  - Population size N (eligible count)
  - Selected rows (K=1) after applying the prepared selection logic; or enable access so the marking/selection can be performed directly

Citations
- Population.xlsx: sole data source referenced by the task for Q2/Q3 metrics, variance analysis, and sampling. All formulas, flags, and selection logic above are designed to be applied to Population.xlsx.",1.0,9,
