Examples:\\\\n   - Ping and traceroute/mtr to affected endpoints.\\\\n   - dig +trace for DNS issues and checking TTLs.\\\\n   - Check BGP: show ip bgp summary / show bgp summary (or cloud provider console BGP status).\\\\n   - Check interface status: show interfaces, ifconfig/ip link, ethtool, check errors/collisions.\\\\n   - Capture packet traces where appropriate (tcpdump with interface and filters) and store with timestamps.\\\\n   - Check cloud provider status pages and routing tables (aws route53 health checks, aws ec2 describe-instances, gcloud compute routes, etc.).\\\\n\\\\n5) Offer immediate mitigation actions (ordered, safe-first):\\\\n   - Reroute traffic (change BGP communities or route-preference) — include escalation requirement for BGP changes.\\\\n   - Failover to standby load balancer or region if runbook allows.\\\\n   - Temporarily increase capacity or remove problematic nodes from load-balancer pool.\\\\n   - Apply firewall rules carefully (avoid broad denies) — include approval step.\\\\n\\\\n6) Provide escalation matrix and time-based escalation policy (e.g., 0–15 min initial triage, 15–30 min mitigation, escalate to network lead at 30 min, EP/engineering manager at 60 min). Include contact placeholders to be filled (on-call names, pager IDs, Slack/phone).\\\\n\\\\n7) Communication templates: incident summary, customer-facing status, internal update cadence, and how to mark incident resolved. Include sample messages.\\\\n\\\\n8) Post-incident steps: root cause analysis (RCA) checklist, collecting logs/pcaps/commands output, timeline reconstruction, follow-up owner assignment, and SLA review.\\\\n\\\\n9) Safety and change controls: require change approvals for production-impacting config changes; avoid configuration rollbacks unless they’re tested; document all commands and changes in the incident log.\\\\n\\\\n10) Verification and closure checklist: confirm systems healthy, confirm monitoring alerts cleared, update PagerDuty incident status, schedule RCA, and inform stakeholders.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, ensure the runbook includes brief reasoning for why steps are ordered (e.g., verify impact first to avoid unnecessary changes; collect evidence before making changes to preserve forensic data).\\\\n\\\\nProduce this runbook excerpt as a single self-contained response (no external tools), with placeholders where team-specific details (names, phone numbers, exact command syntax for proprietary equipment) must be filled in.\"\\n]', 'additional_kwargs': {}}", "{'type': 'ai', 'content': '', 'additional_kwargs': {'usage': {'completion_tokens': 2048, 'prompt_tokens': 1063, 'total_tokens': 3111, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2048, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0, 'text_tokens': None, 'image_tokens': None}}}}"]}}, "output_text": ""}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 2048, "prompt_tokens": 1063, "total_tokens": 3111, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 2048, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "artifacts": {}, "deliverable": "", "result": {"deliverable": "", "artifacts": {}}, "structured_output": {"deliverable": "", "artifacts": {}, "result": {"deliverable": "", "artifacts": {}}, "text": ""}, "text": "", "runtime": {"reward_skipped": true, "timings_ms": {"student_ms": 35365.191, "validation_ms": 0.0, "total_ms": 35365.191}}}}], "execution_mode": "paired", "teacher_intervened": true, "adaptive_summary": {}, "session_metadata": {"learning_key": "89ee3dc1293ebad0d0133941898661da52272f55dd762b1dfc404110fc70247c"}, "focus_prompt": null, "trajectory_type": "cold_start", "task_metadata": {"scenario": "sre", "difficulty": "high"}, "capture_metadata": {"task_index": 2, "repeat": 0, "captured_at": "2025-10-20T00:56:21Z", "task_dataset": "atlas/data/synthetic_runtime_tasks.jsonl"}}

The response should include: (1) a clear objective and rationale, (2) concrete configuration steps and parameters (e.g., initial thresholds, target rates, rolling window sizes), (3) an adaptive update rule or formula (with an example using numbers), (4) safeguards and overrides (teacher override, appeal path), (5) monitoring metrics and alerting, and (6) an example configuration snippet or pseudocode showing how to implement the adaptation loop. Be specific and actionable. Suggested content to include: \\\\n\\\\n- Objective: reduce unnecessary teacher reviews for low-risk plays while preserving student confidence and safety. \\\\n\\\\n- Initial settings: classify playbooks as low-risk; set baseline review probability or threshold (example: auto-approve if confidence >= 0.85; request teacher if confidence < 0.85). Set a target teacher-review rate for low-risk plays (example: 5–10% of low-risk plays). Use a rolling window (e.g., 7 days or 1,000 plays) to measure observed review rate. \\\\n\\\\n- Adaptive update rule: provide a simple formula, e.g., threshold_new = threshold_old + alpha * (observed_rate - target_rate), with alpha (learning rate) = 0.1. Show numeric example: if target_rate = 0.08, observed_rate = 0.20, threshold_old = 0.85, then threshold_new = 0.85 + 0.1 * (0.20 - 0.08) = 0.862. \\\\n\\\\n- Rate-limiting and cooldown: enforce per-student cooldowns (e.g., after a teacher review, disable additional auto-requests for 24 hours) and per-playbook min/max review rates. \\\\n\\\\n- Safeguards: always allow manual teacher override; allow student appeals; require teacher review for flagged exceptions or when confidence is below a hard safety cutoff (e.g., confidence < 0.6). Maintain audit logs and sample reviews for QA. \\\\n\\\\n- Monitoring and metrics: track review_request_rate, teacher_load, false_positive_rate (unnecessary reviews), student satisfaction, time-to-review. Create alerts if teacher_load or review_request_rate exceed thresholds. \\\\n\\\\n- Implementation example (pseudocode or YAML): include code showing computing observed_rate over a window, updating threshold with the formula, and applying min/max bounds. \\\\n\\\\n- Evaluation: run an A/B test or pilot, measure teacher load and student outcomes, and iterate. \\\\n\\\\nInclude concise reasoning for each design choice and at least one numeric example and one short pseudocode/config snippet.

Be specific about which telemetry characteristics matter for compliance.\\n\\n4) Define prioritization criteria and a scoring rubric. At minimum include: compliance impact (severity of non-compliance), security/privacy risk, likelihood/exposure (how often/where gap manifests), operational impact, regulatory deadlines/penalties, and implementation effort. Provide scoring scales (e.g., 1–5) and weights for each criterion. Show the formula for computing a priority score.\\n\\n5) Show how to apply the rubric with 2–4 brief example backlog items (name the item, describe the gap, show criterion scores, compute the priority score, and state the resulting priority rank). This demonstrates reasoning and correctness.\\n\\n6) Provide a recommended prioritized backlog (top 5–8 items), with concise justification for each (why it’s high/medium/low priority).

You must produce a complete, single-response investigation and first-response diagnostics for the checkout API latency alert at 09:45 UTC. Follow these requirements and structure your response accordingly:\\\\n\\\\n1) High-level summary (1–2 sentences)\\\\n   - State what happened (checkout API latency alert at 09:45 UTC), current status (investigating / mitigated / ongoing), and immediate impact (percent of requests affected, SLO risk).\\\\n\\\\n2) Immediate facts to collect (what to check first) — be specific and include where/how to check:\\\\n   - Alert details: alert name, trigger time (09:45 UTC), threshold, alert query. (Reference the alerting system and exact alert rule.)\\\\n   - Scope: which services/hosts/pods/regions are affected. (Mention the monitoring dashboard and log search you will use — e.g., Grafana dashboard “checkout-api latency”, Prometheus query, Datadog monitors, Splunk/ELK search.)\\\\n   - Traffic and error overview: current request rate, error rate, 50/95/99th percentile latencies. Include example PromQL/Datadog queries or the dashboard names.\\\\n   - Recent deploys and configuration changes: check CI/CD/deployment events since 08:00–09:45 UTC (e.g., look at CI pipeline, Git history, deployment timestamps, Kubernetes rollout history: kubectl rollout history deploy/checkout-api -n prod).\\\\n   - Traces: open distributed tracing (Jaeger/Lightstep/Tempo) for slow traces around 09:45; inspect span durations and which downstream calls are slow.\\\\n   - Logs: search for errors/timeouts/exceptions in checkout-api logs around the alert window (give an example query for ELK/Splunk/CloudWatch).\\\\n   - Infrastructure metrics: CPU, memory, thread/connection pool exhaustion, GC, disk IO, network errors on checkout hosts/pods (include the dashboard names or metrics like container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, node_network_errors_total).\\\\n   - Downstream dependencies: database (RDS/Postgres), cache (Redis/Memcached), payment gateway, third-party APIs — check their latency and error metrics.\\\\n   - Queues and backpressure: check message queue lengths, consumer lag (e.g., Kafka consumer lag), and request queue length at the app/load balancer.\\\\n\\\\n3) Step-by-step diagnostic checklist (ordered, with commands/queries/examples):\\\\n   - Verify alert: open Grafana/Datadog monitor -> confirm spike at 09:45. Example PromQL for p95: histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{job=\\\\\"checkout-api\\\\\"}[5m])) by (le))\\\\n   - Confirm traffic: curl health endpoint or run kubectl port-forward to test a sample request; or query request rate: sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\\\\\"checkout-api\\\\\"}[5m])) by (status)\\\\n   - Check error rates and response codes: example query: sum(rate(http_requests_total{job=\\\\\"checkout-api\\\\\",status=~\\\\\"5..\\\\\"}[5m]))\\\\n   - Inspect traces: search for traces with high duration around the time; identify slowest spans and their services.\\\\n   - Inspect logs: example ELK query: service:checkout-api AND timestamp:[2025-10-20T09:40:00 TO 2025-10-20T09:50:00] AND (error OR exception OR timeout)\\\\n   - Check recent deploys: kubectl rollout history, CI pipeline page; if a deploy happened shortly before 09:45, suspect regression.\\\\n   - Check instance/pod status: kubectl get pods -n prod -l app=checkout-api -o wide; kubectl describe pod <pod> for OOMKilled or restart loops.\\\\n   - Check resource usage: Grafana / metrics API: container_cpu_usage_seconds_total, container_memory_usage_bytes; scale issues if CPU or heap exhausted.\\\\n   - Check DB and caches: DB p95 query latency, connection pool utilization; Redis command latency and hit ratio.\\\\n   - Check network/ALB: TLS handshake failures, backend 5xx counts at LB, connection errors.\\\\n\\\\n4) Immediate mitigations (ordered, low-risk first):\\\\n   - Rollforward/rollback: if a deploy at ~09:30 correlates with the spike, consider immediate rollback to previous revision (describe how: kubectl rollout undo deploy/checkout-api -n prod or CI rollback button).\\\\n   - Scale up: temporarily increase replicas or add capacity (kubectl scale deployment/checkout-api --replicas=N or adjust HPA). Document safe limits.\\\\n   - Throttle or circuit-break: reduce load to the checkout service (apply rate limits at API gateway or use ingress weight adjustments) to reduce backpressure.\\\\n   - Route traffic away from affected region/host or enable failover to healthy cluster.\\\\n   - Restart problematic pods (kubectl delete pod) if a subset shows resource exhaustion or bad state.\\\\n\\\\n5) Communication and escalation\\\\n   - Notify: list on-call team, SRE, responsible service owner, product manager, and support. Provide a short status template: what happened, time, impact, mitigation steps in progress, ETA for next update.\\\\n   - If critical and unresolved within X minutes, escalate to pager duty and execs as per runbook.\\\\n\\\\n6) Next steps and follow-up actions\\\\n   - Collect full traces, logs, and dashboards for postmortem.\\\\n   - Preserve data: freeze logging/trace retention for the window, export relevant logs and traces.\\\\n   - Root cause analysis plan: hypothesis list (deploy bug, DB slow query, cache miss storm, third-party latency, resource exhaustion, traffic surge), tests to validate each hypothesis.\\\\n   - Long-term remediation suggestions: add more granular SLOs, synthetic tests, improved alerting (combine latency + error rate + host count), capacity planning, blue-green deploys or canary limits.\\\\n\\\\n7) Example short response message to users/support\\\\n   - \\\\\"We observed elevated checkout API latency starting at 09:45 UTC affecting ~X% of requests (p95 increased from Y ms to Z ms).
