# Atlas SDK Autodiscovery

Atlas now supports a Codex-style onboarding flow for self-managed, stateful agents.
You can go from installation to a working `atlas run` session in three commands:

```bash
pip install arc-atlas
atlas env init
atlas run --task "Investigate the incident summary"
```

`atlas env init` scans your project for `@atlas.environment` and
`@atlas.agent` classes, runs a discovery loop to understand how they
interact, and persists the results under `.atlas/`. Subsequent calls to
`atlas run` read the cached metadata, verify that the module hashes are
still valid, and replay the same control loop while capturing telemetry
for learning evaluation.

The generated files include:

- `.atlas/discover.json` – module hashes, inferred handshake, schema hints,
  telemetry samples, and reward observations from discovery.
- `.atlas/generated_config.yaml` – a stub runtime profile pointing to the
  discovered environment and agent.
- `.atlas/runs/` – JSON artefacts storing telemetry and reward traces for
  each `atlas run` execution.

If you change your environment or agent implementation, re-run
`atlas env init` to refresh the cached metadata before calling
`atlas run` again.
